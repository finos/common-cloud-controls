# CCC Architectures

This directory contains control catalogs that are designed for complex inter-networked systems.

The intent and format of these documents contrasts with the other parts of CCC in approach, but adheres to the same schema.

However, architectures will not always have capabilities or threats documented, as those are likely to be inherited by the shared control catalogs. In the event that additional threats are found, they should have corresponding controls captured within the `control-families` field.

Each directory should also contain a README.md that details the design goals.
