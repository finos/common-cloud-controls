  - title: Identity and Access Management
    description: |
      The Identity and Access Management control family ensures
      that only trusted and authenticated entities can access
      resources. These controls establish strong authentication,
      enforce multi-factor verification, and restrict access to
      approved sources to prevent unauthorized use or data exfiltration.

        title: Least Privilege for Plugins
        objective: |
          Restricts the permissions of any external tools the GenAI system
          can call to limit the potential damage if an agent is coerced
          to perform unintended actions or vulnerabilities in the tools
          are exploited.

              When an LLM invokes an external tool (e.g., an API, a plugin),
              then the tool MUST operate with the least privileges required
              for performing its intended functionality.

  - title: Configuration Management
    description: |
      The Configuration Management control family involves establishing,
      maintaining and monitoring the configuration of the service and
      related applications and infrastructure to ensure consistency,

        title: Model Version Pinning
        objective: |
          Mandate that applications are locked ("pinned") to a specific,
          tested version of a foundational model to prevent unexpected
          behaviour changes introduced by provider-side updates.

            text: |
              When an application makes an API call to a foundational model in a
              production environment, then it MUST specify an explicit version
              identifier.
