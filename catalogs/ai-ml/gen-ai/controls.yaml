        objective: |
          Establish a formal program for quality evaluation and adversarial
          testing (red teaming) to ensure GenAI system meet all business,
          quality, security and compliance requirements before getting deployed
          into production environments.

              When a new AI model is considered for production deployment, it
              MUST undergo a formal red teaming and quality assurance review.

              If model quality review or red teaming identifies an issue that exceeds
              the organization's risk tolerance, the model MUST NOT be deployed until
              the issue is remediated.
