capabilities:
  - id: CCC.Vector.F01
    title: Embedding Storage
    description: |
      Supports storage of high-dimensional vector embeddings derived
      from raw input data such as text, images, or audio.

  - id: CCC.Vector.F02
    title: Vector Indexing
    description: |
      Provides creation and management of indexes optimized for similarity
      search, such as HNSW, IVF, or PQ.

  - id: CCC.Vector.F03
    title: Similarity Search
    description: |
      Enables nearest-neighbor queries using a query embedding to return
      the most similar vectors from the store.

  - id: CCC.Vector.F04
    title: Metadata Filtering
    description: |
      Supports structured filtering on metadata fields alongside vector
      similarity search queries.

  - id: CCC.Vector.F05
    title: Batch Ingestion
    description: |
      Allows for high-throughput batch upload and deletion of vectors and
      associated metadata.

  - id: CCC.Vector.F06
    title: Real-Time Querying
    description: |
      Provides low-latency response to vector similarity queries suitable
      for interactive applications.

  - id: CCC.Vector.F07
    title: Index Lifecycle Management
    description: |
      Enables automated or manual creation, optimization, and removal of
      vector indexes.

  - id: CCC.Vector.F08
    title: Embedding Format Compatibility
    description: |
      Supports standard vector formats and integrates with common embedding
      generators (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace, TensorFlow).

  - id: CCC.Vector.F09
    title: Vector Dimension Management
    description: |
      Supports storing and managing vectors of specific or dynamic
      dimensionality, depending on model needs.

  - id: CCC.Vector.F10
    title: Multi-modal Vector Support
    description: |
      Supports storing and searching across vectors derived from multiple
      modalities (e.g., text, image, audio).

  - id: CCC.Vector.F11
    title: Query Access Control
    description: |
      Provides the ability to restrict who can run vector similarity or
      metadata filter queries, separate from data modification rights.

  - id: CCC.Vector.F12
    title: Approximate or Exact Search Modes
    description: |
      Supports both approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms for speed
      and exact search modes for precision-critical applications.
