  description: |
    A Managed Vector Store is a specialized data service designed to store, index, and
    retrieve high-dimensional vector embeddings, enabling similarity search and machine
    learning inference. These services are used in AI/ML pipelines for use cases such as
    semantic search, recommendation systems, and generative AI applications. Vector
    stores support operations like nearest neighbor search using approximate or exact
    methods and integrate with model-serving and ingestion pipelines. They are
    optimized for performance, scale, and integration with cloud-native tools.
