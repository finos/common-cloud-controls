    title: Embedding Extraction and Model Inversion
    description: Attackers may infer or reconstruct original data by probing vector
      similarity APIs, especially with unrestricted access. This enables model inversion
      attacks, membership inference, and unauthorized data leakage from stored embeddings.

      through ingestion endpoints, polluting the dataset and degrading search quality,
      or subtly steering results toward specific outcomes.

    title: Cross-modal or Metadata Leakage
    description: Attackers may infer sensitive information through metadata filters
      or by correlating embeddings across modalities (e.g., voice and face), bypassing
      surface-level access controls.

      crashes or logic errors. This can result in denial of service or incorrect similarity
      results.
