threats:
  - id: CCC.Vector.TH01
    title: Embedding Extraction and Model Inversion
    description: Attackers may infer or reconstruct original data by probing vector
      similarity APIs, especially with unrestricted access. This enables model inversion
      attacks, membership inference, and unauthorized data leakage from stored embeddings.

    title: Embedding and Index Poisoning
    description: Adversaries may insert malicious or adversarial vectors into the index
      through ingestion endpoints, polluting the dataset and degrading search quality,
      or subtly steering results toward specific outcomes.

    title: Cross-modal or Metadata Leakage
    description: Attackers may infer sensitive information through metadata filters
      or by correlating embeddings across modalities (e.g., voice and face), bypassing
      surface-level access controls.

      with or roll back index versions, potentially restoring poisoned data or breaking
      downstream integrations.

      crashes or logic errors. This can result in denial of service or incorrect similarity
      results.

    title: Search Result Manipulation via ANN Bias
    description: Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms may yield non-deterministic
      or biased results. Adversaries may exploit these differences to evade detection
      or bias AI responses.
