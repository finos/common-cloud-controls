      This initial release is part of the first batch of control catalogs
      produced by the CCC. It is the result of thousands of hours dedicated to
      exploring different ways of working and collaborating, on top of time
      spent researching, writing, and reviewing the content. This marks a huge
      milestone for the CCC and the broader community as further releases will
      continue to build on this foundation. A huge thanks to everyone who has
      brought us to this point!
