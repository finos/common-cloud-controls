        title: Enforce Use of Managed Views for Data Access
        objective: |
          Ensure that data access is provided through managed views, restricting users
          from accessing underlying tables directly and enforcing consistent security policies.

              Attempt to access underlying database tables directly without
              using managed views and verify that access is denied.
