  description: |
    Virtual machines are virtualized instances of computer hardware that
    emulate physical servers and run operating systems and applications.
    Users can provision VMs with custom configurations, including CPU,
    memory, storage, and networking resources. Cloud providers offer managed
    VM services with capabilities such as automated provisioning, scaling,
    monitoring, and pay-as-you-go pricing.
