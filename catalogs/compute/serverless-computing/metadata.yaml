  description: |
    Serverless computing, also known as Function as a Service (FaaS), allows
    users to deploy and run code functions without provisioning or managing
    servers. Cloud providers abstract infrastructure management tasks, such
    server provisioning, scaling, and maintenance, enabling users to focus
    on writing and deploying code.
