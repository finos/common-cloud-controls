        title: Enforce Use of Private Endpoints for Serverless Function
        objective: |
          Ensure that the serverless function is accessible only through a private endpoint,
          allowing it to communicate securely within a virtual private network and preventing
          unauthorized external access.

        title: Implement Function Invocation Rate Limits
        objective: |
          Ensure that function invocation is limited to a specified threshold from any single entity,
          preventing resource exhaustion and denial of service attacks.

              Send requests to invoke the function up to the allowed threshold and confirm they
              are successful; then send additional requests exceeding the threshold from the same
              entity and verify that they are denied.
