  description: |
    Batch processing services enable users to execute large-scale,
    parallelizable computing tasks, such as data processing, analytics, and
    batch jobs. These services automatically allocate and manage compute
    to execute batch jobs efficiently and cost-effectively. Users
    can specify job requirements, dependencies, and scheduling preferences
    to optimize job execution.
