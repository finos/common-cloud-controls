        title: Restrict Default Network Creation
        objective: |
          Restrict the automatic creation of default virtual networks and related
          resources during subscription initialization to avoid insecure default
          configurations and enforce custom network policies.

              When a subscription is created, the subscription MUST NOT
              contain default network resources.
