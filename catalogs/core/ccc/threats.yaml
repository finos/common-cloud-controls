      Logic designed to give different permissions to different entities may
      be misconfigured or manipulated, allowing unauthorized entities to access
      restricted parts of the service, its data, or its child resources.
      This could result in a loss of data confidentiality or tolerance of
      unauthorized actions which impact the integrity and availability of
      resources and data.
