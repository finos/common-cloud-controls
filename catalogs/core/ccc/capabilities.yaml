# Capabilities Style Guide
#
# - Titles should be concise and use title case.
# - Descriptions should be clear, complete sentences.
# - Begin each description with "The service..."
# - Specify whether a feature is one or more of the following: 
#    - default ("always" if a state or "automatically" if an action)
#    - configurable ("may be configured")
#    - ad hoc ("can")
# - Use a formal, objective, tone.
# - Use present tense and active voice.
# - State what the service does — not what it enables, prevents, avoids, or lacks.
# - Use precise technical terms and consistent terminology. Update this list where possible:
#    - user: an individual or entity that interacts with the service
#    - component: an actor within the scope of the service itself
#    - child resource: an actor that is created, managed, or contained outside the bounds of the service
# - Structure each capability with: id, title, description.
