      The Data control family ensures the confidentiality, integrity,
      availability, and sovereignty of data across its lifecycle.
      These controls govern how data is transmitted, stored,
      replicated, and protected from unauthorized access, tampering,
      or exposure beyond defined trust perimeters.

        objective: |
          Ensure that secure access controls prevent unauthorized access,
          mitigate risks of data exfiltration, and block misuse of services
          by adversaries. This includes restricting access based on trust
          criteria such as IP allowlists, domain restrictions, and tenant
          isolation.
