  - title: Data
    description: |
      The Data control family ensures the confidentiality, integrity,
      availability, and sovereignty of data across its lifecycle.
      These controls govern how data is transmitted, stored,
      replicated, and protected from unauthorized access, tampering,
      or exposure beyond defined trust perimeters.

              When a port is exposed for non-SSH network traffic, all traffic
              MUST include a TLS handshake AND be encrypted using TLS 1.3 or
              higher.

            recommendation: |
              Most cloud services enable TLS 1.3 by default. Where it is not
              already set, ensure that your services are configured or updated
              accordingly.

              When a port is exposed for SSH network traffic, all traffic MUST

            recommendation: |
              Any time port 22 is exposed, ensure that it has a properly

              When the service receives unencrypted traffic,

            recommendation: |
              Review firewall, load balancer, and application configurations to
              ensure insecure protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and Telnet are not
              exposed. Where possible, implement automatic redirection to secure
              protocols such as HTTPS, SFTP, SSH, and regularly scan for
              protocol drift.

              other, is run on that port.

              Reference the IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number
              Registry for more information about correct protocol-to-port
              assignments. Avoid running non-standard services on well-known

              When a service transmits data using TLS, mutual TLS (mTLS) MUST be
              implemented to require both client and server certificate
              authentication for all connections.

            recommendation: |
              Configure mTLS for all endpoints that process or transmit
              sensitive data. Ensure both client and server certificates are
              validated and managed securely. Regularly review certificate
              authorities and automate certificate rotation where possible.

            recommendation: |
              Implement event publication mechanisms and alerts for patterns
              indicative of enumeration activities, such as repeated access
              attempts, requests, or liveness probes. Configure alerts to notify
              security teams of any activities that merit further investigation.

            text: |
              When enumeration activities are detected, the service MUST log the
              client identity, time, and nature of the activity.

            recommendation: |
              Implement logging mechanisms to capture details of enumeration
              activities, including client identity, timestamps, and activity
              nature. Retain logs according to organizational policies, and
              occasionally review them for patterns that may indicate
              reconnaissance activities.
