    description: |
        The Common Cloud Controls Core catalog serves as a foundational repository
        of reusable security controls, capabilities, and threat models that can be
        referenced and imported by other service-specific catalogs. This provides
        a centralized mechanism for maintaining consistency and reducing
        duplication across the broader controls ecosystem.
