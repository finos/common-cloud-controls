    description: |
        Object Storage is a data management architecture that handles data as objects,
        rather than as files or blocks. Each object contains the stored data,
        metadata, and a unique identifier, making it ideal for storing large amounts
        of unstructured data such as multimedia files, backups, and archives. It is
        highly scalable and often used in cloud environments due to its flexibility
        and accessibility.
