  description: |
      Object storage is a data storage architecture that manages data as objects,
      rather than as files or blocks. Each object contains the data itself,
      metadata, and a unique identifier, making it ideal for storing large amounts
      of unstructured data such as multimedia files, backups, and archives. It is
      highly scalable and often used in cloud environments due to its flexibility
      and accessibility.
