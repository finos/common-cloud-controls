FINOS Common Cloud Controls (FINOS CCC) is an open standard project that describes consistent controls for compliant public cloud deployments in the financial services (FS) sector.

This standard is a collaborative project which aims to develop a unified set of cybersecurity, resiliency, and compliance controls for common services across the major cloud service providers (CSPs).

## How To Use It

- **For controls development:** Download the latest [release PDF or Markdown](https://github.com/finos/common-cloud-controls/releases) for your target service, and use that as the basis for developing a control catalog for your specific organization or use case

- **For automation development:** Download the latest [release YAML for your target service](https://github.com/finos/common-cloud-controls/releases), and build tests for each “Test Requirement,” organized according to the control they are part of. Open source validators are currently being developed by the [Compliant Financial Infrastructure](https://github.com/finos/compliant-financial-infrastructure) project.

## How To Contribute

There are several ways to contribute to FINOS Common Cloud Controls.

### 2. Join FINOS CCC Project Meetings

The CCC project is split into 6 working groups as follows:

- **Communications / All Hands**: Focused on the overall project communications and community engagement.
- **Security** - Working to specify the security controls and threats that will be covered by the standard.
- **Community Structure** - Focused on the governance and structure of the CCC project.
- **Taxonomy** - Focused on defining the taxonomy of cloud services that will be covered by the standard.
- **Delivery** - Focused on the delivery of the CCC standard for use downstream by FS firms and CSPs.
- **Compliant Financial Infrastructure** - Focused on delivery of actual implemetations of cloud infrastructure meeting CCC standards.

Work is done in the open, with all meetings and decisions documented in the project GitHub repository. Working groups meet on a fortnightly basis:
