    description: |
      Unauthorized access to logs or monitoring data can provide attackers with
      valuable information about the system's configuration, operations, and
      security mechanisms. This can be used to identify vulnerabilities, plan

    title: Event Notifications are Incorrectly Triggered
    description: |
      Malicious actors may exploit event notifications to trigger sensitive
      operations or access patterns. Alternately, attackers may flood the
      system with notifications to obfuscate another attack or overwhelm the
      service to disrupt legitimate operations.

  - id: CCC.TH12 # Resource constraints are exhausted
    title: Resource constraints are exhausted
    description: |
      An attack or misconfiguration can consume all available resources, such
      as memory, CPU, or storage, to disrupt the service or deny access to
      legitimate users. This can be achieved through repeated requests,
      resource-intensive operations, or the lowering of rate/budget limits.
      Through auto-scaling, the attacker may also attempt to exhaust
      higher-level budget thresholds to impact other systems in the same scope.

    title: Automated Enumeration and Reconnaissance by Non-Human Entities
    description: |
      Attackers may deploy automated processes or bots to perform reconnaissance
      activities by enumerating resources such as APIs, file systems, or directories.
      These activities can help attackers identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations,
      or unsecured resources, which can then be exploited for unauthorized access
      or data theft.
