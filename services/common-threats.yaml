    title: Logs are Tampered With or Deleted
    description: |
      Attackers may tamper with or delete logs to cover their tracks and evade 
      detection. This prevents security teams from identifying the full scope 
      of an attack and may disrupt forensic investigations.

    title: Cost Management Data is Manipulated
    description: |
      Attackers may manipulate cost management data to hide excessive resource 
      consumption or to deceive users about resource usage. This could be used 
      to exhaust budgets, cause financial losses, or evade detection of other attacks.

  - id: CCC.TH09 # Logs or Monitoring Data are Read by Unauthorized Users
    title: Logs or Montoring Data are Read by Unauthorized Users
    description: |
      Unauthorized access to logs or monitoring data can provide attackers with
      valuable information about the system's configuration, operations, and
      security mechanisms. This can be used to identify vulnerabilities, plan
      attacks, or evade detection.

    title: Event Notifications are Incorrectly Triggered
    description: |
      Malicious actors may exploit event notifications to trigger sensitive
      operations or access patterns. Alternately, attackers may flood the
      system with notifications to obfuscate another attack or overwhelm the
      service to disrupt legitimate operations.

  - id: CCC.TH12 # Resource constraints are exhausted
    title: Resource constraints are exhausted
    description: |
      An attack or misconfiguration can consume all available resources, such
      as memory, CPU, or storage, to disrupt the service or deny access to 
      legitimate users. This can be achieved through repeated requests,
      resource-intensive operations, or the lowering of rate/budget limits.
      Through auto-scaling, the attacker may also attempt to exhaust
      higher-level budget thresholds to impact other systems in the same scope.

    title: Older Resource Versions Are Exploited
    description: |
      Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in older versions of resources, 
      taking advantage of deprecated or insecure configurations. Without 
      proper version control and monitoring, outdated versions can be used 
      to bypass security measures.
