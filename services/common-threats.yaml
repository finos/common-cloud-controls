    title: Unauthorized access through elevated privileges
    description: |
      An attacker can exploit misconfigured access controls to gain
      unauthorized access to sensitive resources by granting excessive privileges.

    title: Vendor-hosted keys are compromised
    description: |
      The service uses a vendor-hosted key management service (KMS) to manage
      encryption keys. Insider threats or mistakes can result in access by a
      threat actor.

    title: Attacker intercepts data in transit
    description: |
      The service allows unencrypted communication (e.g., HTTP). An attacker
      can intercept traffic between clients and the service to read or modify
      the data during transmission.

    title: Attacker encrypts data with client-managed keys
    description: |
      The service provides encryption mechanisms, but the encryption keys are
      managed by the client. An attacker with access to the service can encrypt
      the data, rendering it inaccessible without the decryption key they hold.
      Additionally, an attacker may alter the encryption key management settings
      to prevent access to data.
