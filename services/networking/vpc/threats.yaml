    title: Unauthorized Access via Insecure Default Networks
    description: |
      Default network configurations may include insecure settings and open
      firewall rules,leading to unauthorized access and potential data
      breaches.

    title: Exposure of Resources to Public Internet
    description: |
      Assignment of external IP addresses to resources exposes resources to the
      public internet, increasing the risk of attacks such as brute force,
      exploitation of vulnerabilities, or unauthorized access.

    title: Unauthorized Network Access Through VPC Peering
    description: |
      Unauthorized VPC peering connections can allow network traffic between
      untrusted or unapproved subscriptions, leading to potential data
      exposure or exfiltration.

    title: Lack of Network Visibility due to Disabled VPC Flow Logs
    description: |
      VPC subnets with disabled flow logs lack critical network traffic
      visibility, which can lead to undetected unauthorized access,
      data exfiltration, and network misconfigurations. This lack of
      visibility increases the risk of undetected security incidents.

    title: Overly Permissive VPC Endpoint Policies
    description: |
      VPC Endpoint policies that are overly permissive may inadvertently expose
      resources within the VPC to unintended principals or external threats.
