    title: Exposure of Resources to Public Internet
    description: |
      Assignment of external IP addresses to resources exposes them to the public internet, increasing the risk of attacks such as brute force, exploitation of vulnerabilities, or unauthorized access.
    features:
      - CCC.VPC.F02  # External IP Address Assignment
    mitre_technique:
      - T1133  # External Remote Services
      - T1078  # Valid Accounts

    title: Unauthorized Network Access through VPC Peering
    description: |
      Unauthorized VPC peering connections can allow network traffic between untrusted or unapproved subscriptions, leading to potential data exposure or exfiltration.
    features:
      - CCC.VPC.F11 # VPC Peering
    mitre_technique:
      - T1599  # Network Boundary Bridging

  - id: CCC.VPC.TH05
    title: Lack of Network Visibility Due to Disabled VPC Flow Logs
    description: |
      VPC subnets with disabled flow logs lack critical network traffic visibility, which can lead to undetected unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and network misconfigurations. This lack of visibility increases the risk of undetected security incidents.
    features:
      - CCC.VPC.F16  # VPC Flow Logs
    mitre_technique:
      - T1580 # Cloud Infrastructure Discovery

  - id: CCC.VPC.TH06
    title: Unauthorized Exposure to the Internet via Internet Gateway Routes
    description: |
      Route tables configured with routes to an Internet Gateway allow direct exposure of network resources to the public internet. 
    features:
      - CCC.VPC.XX  # Route Table
    mitre_technique:
      - T1011  # Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol

  - id: CCC.VPC.TH07
    title: Misconfigured or Unauthorized Access to VPC Endpoints
    description: |
      Misconfigured or unauthorized VPC Endpoints can expose private network resources to unauthorized access, bypassing traditional network controls. This may lead to data exposure or exploitation of services through unintended access paths.
    features:
      - CCC.VPC.F17  # VPC Endpoints
    mitre_technique:
      - T1071  # Application Layer Protocol
