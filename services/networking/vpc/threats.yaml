    title: Unauthorized Network Traffic Routing
    description: |
      Enabling IP forwarding on virtual machines allows them to route traffic,
      which can be exploited to redirect traffic, bypass network controls,
      or launch attacks within the network.
    features:
      - CCC.VPC.F03 # IP Forwarding
    mitre_technique:
      - T1590 # Gather Victim Network Information
      - T1021 # Remote Services
