    title: Static Load Balancing
    description: |
      Employ load balancing algorithms that follow fixed rules,
      independent of the current server state.
  - id: CCC.LB.F02
    title: Dynamic Load Balancing
    description: |
      Employ load balancing algorithms that consider the current state
      of servers before distributing traffic. Load balancer adjusts traffic
      distribution in real-time based on the current server health, resource
      utilization, and traffic conditions.
  - id: CCC.LB.F03
    title: Layer 7 Routing
    description: |
      Providing distribution of incoming traffic based on the application layer
      or layer 7 (on ISO model) information. Some of the supported protocols on
      layer 7 are HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP/2, gRPC, and WebSockets.
  - id: CCC.LB.F04
    title: Layer 4 Routing
    description: |
      Providing distribution of incoming traffic based on the
      transport layer or layer 4 (on ISO model) information. It uses
      the combination of IP addresses and TCP/UDP port to distribute incoming
      traffic rather than inspecting the actual content of the packets.
  - id: CCC.LB.F05
    title: URL-Based Routing
    description: |
      Direct incoming requests to different backend resources based on
      the content of the request URL.
  - id: CCC.LB.F06
    title: HTTP Header-Based Routing
    description: |
      Direct incoming requests to different backend resources based on
      the values of HTTP headers.
  - id: CCC.LB.F07
    title: WebSocket Support
    description: |
      Ability to support web socket communication.
  - id: CCC.LB.F08
    title: Dual-stack Load Balancing
    description: |
      Ability to support traffic originated from both IPv4 and IPv6.
  - id: CCC.LB.F09
    title: Load Balancer Autoscaling
    description: |
      Ability for the load balancer to dynamically adjust its capacity
      in response to fluctuations in incoming traffic.
  - id: CCC.LB.F10
    title: Target Autoscaling
    description: |
      Ability for the load balancer to trigger scaling actions of the
      backend instances (targets) to handle fluctuations in incoming traffic.
  - id: CCC.LB.F11
    title: SSL/TLS Termination
    description: |
      Process of decrypting SSL or TLS encrypted traffic at the load balancer
      level rather than at the backend servers. This allows the load balancer
      to offload the decryption task from the backend servers.
  - id: CCC.LB.F12
    title: Target Health Checks
    description: |
      Ability to continuously perform health checks on backend backend targets
      in form of checking the response to HTTP request, TCP connection or checking
      other application-specific parameter
  - id: CCC.LB.F13
    title: Health Checks-based Target Removal
    description: |
      If the health check detects that a backend target is unhealthy
      the load balancer will remove that unhealthy target from its list
      of available backend instances. This ensures that traffic is no longer
      routed to the unhealthy target.
  - id: CCC.LB.F14
    title: Retries
    description: |
      Ability to retry delivery of failed requests to targets. The conditions
      under which the load balancer retries, how long to wait before retrying,
      and the maximum number of retries permitted are configurable.
  - id: CCC.LB.F15
    title: Session Affinity
    description: |
      Can configure subsequent requests from an initial client to be
      passed to the same target.
  - id: CCC.LB.F16
    title: URL Redirects
    description: |
      Redirect incoming traffic to a different URL or location.
  - id: CCC.LB.F17
    title: URL Rewrites
    description: |
      Rewrite URL paths before forwarding them to backend services.
  - id: CCC.LB.F18
    title: Custom Response
    description: |
      Ability to configure specific HTTP responses to be returned by
      the load balancer under defined conditions.
  - id: CCC.LB.F19
    title: Request and Response Header Transformations
    description: |
      Ability to modify HTTP headers of both incoming requests and outgoing
      responses.
  - id: CCC.LB.F20
    title: Traffic Splitting / Weighted Routing
    description: |
      Can distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend resources
      based on predefined weights or percentages (e.g., for canary
      deployments, A/B testing, blue-green deployments, or gradual
      traffic migrations).
  - id: CCC.LB.F21
    title: Traffic Mirroring
    description: |
      Can duplicate incoming network traffic and send it to a secondary
      destination for monitoring, analysis, or testing purposes.
  - id: CCC.LB.F22
    title: Rate Limiting / Throttling
    description: |
      Ability to limit the number of requests per second per client. This
      ensures that no single client or user overloads the backend servers,
      distributing requests fairly across multiple instances.
  - id: CCC.LB.F23
    title: Firewall Integration
    description: |
      Ability to seamlessly integrate with firewall services to ensure only
      legitimate and secure traffic reaches backend servers, blocking malicious
      requests.
