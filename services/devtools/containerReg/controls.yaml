    title: Implement Vulnerability Scanning for Artifacts
    objective: |
      Ensure that container images and artifacts stored in the container registry are scanned for
      vulnerabilities to identify and remediate security issues before deployment.

      Ensure that unused or outdated artifacts are cleaned up according to defined policies to
      manage storage effectively and reduce security risks associated with outdated versions.
