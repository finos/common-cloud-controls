        title: Implement Vulnerability Scanning for Artifacts
        objective: |
          Ensure that container images and artifacts stored in the container registry are scanned for
          vulnerabilities to identify and remediate security issues before deployment.

              Attempt to push an artifact with known vulnerabilities to the registry
              and observe if it is flagged or rejected by the vulnerability scanning process.

        objective: |
          Ensure that unused or outdated artifacts are cleaned up according to defined policies to
          manage storage effectively and reduce security risks associated with outdated versions.

              deleted from the registry.
