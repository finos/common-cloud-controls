    title: Restrict Allowed Build Agents
    objective: |
      Ensure that builds are executed only on authorized build agents to maintain
      control over the build environment and prevent unauthorized code execution.

    title: Deny External Network Access for Build Environments
    objective: |
      Ensure that build environments do not have external network access to
      prevent unauthorized external access and data exfiltration.
