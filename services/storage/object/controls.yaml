    title: Prevent Requests to Buckets or Objects with Untrusted KMS Keys
    objective: |
      Prevent any requests to object storage buckets or objects using 
      untrusted KMS keys to protect against unauthorized data encryption 
      that can impact data availability and integrity.

    control_family: Identity and Access Management
    objective: |
      Ensure that uniform bucket-level access is enforced across all 
      object storage buckets. This prevents the use of ad-hoc or 
      inconsistent object-level permissions, ensuring centralized, 
      consistent, and secure access management in accordance with the 
      principle of least privilege.

    objective: |
      Ensure that all objects stored in the object storage system have a 
      retention policy applied by default, preventing premature deletion 
      or modification of objects and ensuring compliance with data retention 
      regulations.
