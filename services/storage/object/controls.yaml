    title: Prevent Requests to Buckets or Objects with Untrusted KMS Keys
    objective: |
      Prevent any requests to object storage buckets or objects using untrusted
      KMS keys to protect against unauthorized data encryption that can impact
      data availability and integrity.

          Verify that access policies for cloud storage buckets and objects
          prevent requests with untrusted KMS keys. In this case, an untrusted
          KMS key is one that is not specified as trusted by the cloud storage
          bucket owner.

    title: Enforce uniform bucket-level access to prevent inconsistent permissions
    control_family: Identity and Access Management
    objective: |
      Ensure that uniform bucket-level access is enforced across all object storage buckets. 
      This prevents the use of ad-hoc or inconsistent object-level permissions, ensuring 
      centralized, consistent, and secure access management in accordance with the principle 
      of least privilege.

    title: Prevent bucket deletion through irrevocable bucket retention policy
    control_family: Data
    objective: |
      Ensure that object storage bucket is not deleted after creation,
      and that the preventative measure cannot be unset.
    threats:
      - CCC.TH06 # Data is lost or corrupted
    nist_csf: PR.DS-1

        01: |

          Confirm that the bucket retention policy cannot be modified or unset.

  - id: CCC.ObjStor.C05
    title: Objects have an effective retention policy by default
    control_family: Data
    objective: |
      Ensure that all objects stored in the object storage system have a retention policy 
      applied by default, preventing premature deletion or modification of objects and ensuring 
      compliance with data retention regulations.

          Attempt to modify or remove the retention policy on an object and confirm that it cannot be altered or deleted without explicit authorization.
        03: |
          Confirm that the retention policy is enforced and prevents premature deletion of objects within the defined retention period.
  - id: CCC.ObjStor.C06
    title: Versioning is enabled for all objects in the bucket
    control_family: Data
    objective: |
      Ensure that versioning is enabled for all objects stored in the object
      storage bucket to enable recovery of previous versions of objects in case
      of loss or corruption.

          objects are stored with unique identifiers.

          Verify that previous versions of an object can be accessed and restored 
          after an object is modified or deleted.

    title: Access logs are stored in a separate bucket
    control_family: Data
    objective: |
      Ensure that access logs for object storage buckets are stored in a separate
      bucket to protect against unauthorized access, tampering, or deletion of
      logs (Logbuckets are exempt from this requirement, but must be tlp_red).
    threats:
      - CCC.TH07 # Logs are Tampered With or Deleted

    title: Prevent object replication to desinations outside of defined trust perimeter
    control_family: Data
    objective: |
      Prevent replicating objects to untrusted destinations outside of defined trust perimeter. 
      An untrusted destination is defined as a resource that exists outside of a specified 
      trusted identity or network perimeter (i.e., a data perimeter).
