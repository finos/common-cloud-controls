    title: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access
    objective: Ensure that all human user access to object storage buckets requires multi-factor authentication (MFA), minimizing the risk of unauthorized access by enforcing strong authentication mechanisms.

    test_requirements:
      01: Verify that MFA is enforced for all access attempts to the object storage bucket.
      02: Ensure that MFA is required for all administrative access to the storage management interface.
      03: Confirm that users are unable to access the object storage bucket without completing MFA.

    title: Maintain immutable backups of data
    objective: Ensure that data stored in the object storage bucket is immutable for a defined period, preventing unauthorized modifications or deletions and thereby mitigating data destruction.

        - CP-9
    test_requirements:
      01: Verify that data in the object storage bucket is protected by immutability settings.
      02: Ensure that attempts to modify or delete data within the immutability period are denied.
      03: Confirm that immutable data remains unchanged throughout the defined retention period.
