  title: Object Storage
  description: |
      Object storage is a data storage architecture that manages data as objects,
      rather than as files or blocks. Each object contains the data itself,
      metadata, and a unique identifier, making it ideal for storing large amounts
      of unstructured data such as multimedia files, backups, and archives. It is
      highly scalable and often used in cloud environments due to its flexibility
      and accessibility.

      summary: |
        This initial release is part of the first batch of control catalogs
        produced by the CCC. It is the result of thousands of hours dedicated to
        exploring different ways of working and collaborating, on top of time
        spent researching, writing, and reviewing the content. This marks a huge
        milestone for the CCC and the broader community as further releases will
        continue to build on this foundation. A huge thanks to everyone who has
        brought us to this point!
