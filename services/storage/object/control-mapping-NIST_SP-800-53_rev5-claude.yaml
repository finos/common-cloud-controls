mappings:
  - from: CCC.ObjStor.C01 # Prevent Requests to Buckets or Objects with Untrusted KMS Keys
    to:
      - id: SC-28 # Protection of Information at Rest
        justification: The control is mapped to the NIST 800-53 SC-28 control because it is a requirement for protecting information at rest.

  - from: CCC.ObjStor.C02 # Enforce Uniform Bucket-level Access to Prevent Inconsistent Permissions
    to:
      - id: AC-3 # Access Enforcement
        justification: This control maps to AC-3 as it enforces approved authorizations for logical access to information
      and system resources.
      - id:  AC-6 # Least Privilege
        justification: Maps to AC-6 as it implements the principle of least privilege by ensuring consistent bucket-level permissions.

  - from: CCC.ObjStor.C03 # Prevent Bucket Deletion Through Irrevocable Bucket Retention Policy
    to:
      - id: SC-28 # Protection of Information at Rest
        justification: Maps to SC-28 as it protects stored data from deletion through retention policies.
      - id: AU-11 # Audit Record Retention
        justification: Maps to AU-11 as it enforces retention requirements for stored data.
      - id: CP-10 # System Recovery and Reconstitution
        justification: Maps to CP-10 by ensuring data can be recovered after deletion attempts within retention period.

  - from: CCC.ObjStor.C04 # Objects have an Effective Retention Policy by Default
    to:
      - id: SC-28 # Protection of Information at Rest
        justification: Maps to SC-28 by protecting stored data through default retention policies.
      - id: AU-11 # Audit Record Retention
        justification: Maps to AU-11 by enforcing retention requirements for all stored objects by default.
      - id: CM-2 # Baseline Configuration
        justification: Maps to CM-2 as it establishes a baseline configuration for object retention.

  - from: CCC.ObjStor.C05 # Versioning is Enabled for All Objects in the Bucket
    to:
      - id: SC-28 # Protection of Information at Rest
        justification: Maps to SC-28 by protecting stored data through versioning.
      - id: CP-9 # Information System Backup
        justification: Maps to CP-9 as versioning provides a form of backup for modified or deleted objects.
      - id: CP-10 # System Recovery and Reconstitution
        justification: Maps to CP-10 by enabling recovery of previous versions of objects.

  - from: CCC.ObjStor.C06 # Access Logs are Stored in a Separate Data Store
    to:
      - id: AU-4 # Audit Storage Capacity
        justification: Maps to AU-4 by ensuring adequate separate storage for access logs.
      - id: AU-9 # Protection of Audit Information
        justification: Maps to AU-9 by protecting audit logs through separation from the primary data store.
      - id: AU-11 # Audit Record Retention
        justification: Maps to AU-11 by enabling secure retention of access logs.
