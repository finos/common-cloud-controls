|------------|-----------|------|---------------------|----------|--------------------------|---------|
| CCC.OS.C1  | Prevent unencrypted requests to object storage bucket | GIVEN you own the object storage bucket; WHEN an unencrypted HTTP request is made to the bucket; THEN the request should be denied | CCC-020115 | Protect | [M1041](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1041) | CCC.OS.T1 |
| CCC.OS.C2  | Prevent object storage data encrypted for impact | GIVEN you own the object storage bucket; WHEN a data plane request with an untrusted KMS key is made to the object storage bucket; THEN the request should be denied | CCC-020114 | Protect | None | CCC.OS.T2 |
| CCC.OS.C3  | Prevent the granting of direct public access to the object storage bucket you own | GIVEN you own the object storage bucket; WHEN the access controls on the bucket are updated to grant public access to the bucket; THEN the request should be denied | CCC-020116 | Protect | [M1022](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1022/)| CCC.OS.T3 |
| CCC.OS.C4  | Ensure that all access to the object storage bucket is restricted by the outermost data perimeter achievable based on identity, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and data exfiltration by enforcing strict identity-based access controls at the the outermost boundary for the object storage service. | GIVEN you own the object storage bucket; AND the outermost identity-based data perimeter for the bucket is configured to deny access from outside that data perimeter; WHEN an identity outside the data perimeter attempts to access the bucket; THEN access should be denied | CCC-020116 | Protect | [M1022](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1022/)| CCC.OS.T3 |
