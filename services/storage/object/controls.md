|------------|-----------|------|---------------------|----------|--------------------------|---------|
| CCC.OS.C1  | Prevent unencrypted requests to object storage bucket | GIVEN you own the object storage bucket; WHEN an unencrypted HTTP request is made to the bucket; THEN the request is denied | CCC-020115 | Protect | [M1041](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1041) | CCC.OS.T1 |
| CCC.OS.C2  | Prevent object storage data encrypted for impact | GIVEN you own the object storage bucket; WHEN a data plane request with an untrusted KMS key is made to the object storage bucket; THEN the request is denied | CCC-020114 | Protect | None | CCC.OS.T2 |
| CCC.OS.C3  | Prevent the granting of direct public access to the object storage bucket you own | GIVEN you own the object storage bucket; WHEN the access controls on the bucket are updated to grant public access to the bucket; THEN the request is denied | CCC-020116 | Protect | [M1022](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1022/)| CCC.OS.T3 |
| CCC.OS.C4  | Ensure that all access to the object storage bucket is restricted by the outermost data perimeter achievable based on identity, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and data exfiltration by enforcing strict identity-based access controls at the the outermost boundary for the object storage service. | GIVEN you own the object storage bucket;  WHEN an identity outside the outermost identity-based data perimeter attempts to access the bucket; THEN access is denied | CCC-020116 | Protect | [M1022](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1022/)| CCC.OS.T3 |
| CCC.OS.C5  | Ensure that all human user access to object storage bucket requires multi-factor authentication (MFA), minimizing the risk of unauthorized access by enforcing strong authentication mechanisms.| GIVEN you own the object storage bucket; WHEN an identity without valid MFA attempts to access the bucket; THEN access is denied | CCC-020116 | Protect | [M1022](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1022/)| CCC.OS.T3 |
| CCC.OS.C6  | Ensure that all communications with object storage buckets use the latest available TLS version to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.| GIVEN you own the object storage bucket; WHEN an entity attempts to connect to the object storage bucket with an outdated TLS version; THEN the connection is denied | CCC-020116 | Protect | [M1022](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1022/)| CCC.OS.T3 |
| CCC.OS.C7  | Ensure that data stored in the object storage bucket is immutable for a defined period, preventing unauthorized modifications or deletions and thereby mitigating data destruction.| GIVEN you own the object storage bucket; WHEN an attempt is made to modify objects in the bucket during the defined immutability retention period; THEN the modification is denied | CCC-020116 | Protect | [M1022](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1022/)| CCC.OS.T3 |
