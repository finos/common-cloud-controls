    title: Compromised encrpytion keys
    description: |
      If encryption keys for object storage are compromised, attackers can
      decrypt sensitive data or forge access tokens to retrieve stored objects.
      This might include encryption at rest or signed URLs.
    features:
      - CCC.F02 # Encryption at Rest Enabled by Default
      - CCC.F05 # Signed URLs
    mitre_technique:
      - T1552 # Unsecured Credentials
      - T1556 # Modify Authentication Process
      - T1078.004 # Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts
      - T1565 # Data Manipulation

  - id: CCC.ObjStor.TH04 # Data exfiltration via insecure lifecycle policies
    title: Data exfiltration via insecure lifecycle policies
    description: |
      Misconfigured lifecycle policies may unintentionally allow data to be
      exfiltrated or destroyed prematurely, resulting in a loss of availability
      and potential exposure of sensitive data.
    features:
      - CCC.ObjStor.F08 # Lifecycle Policies
      - CCC.F09 # Data Replication
      - CCC.F10 # Data Backup

    title: Overly permissive access control policies
    description: |
      Inadequate access control policies on individual objects or buckets can
      lead to sensitive data exposure, allowing unauthorized users to read or
      modify critical data.
    features:
      - CCC.ObjStor.F11 # Object Level Access Control
      - CCC.ObjStor.F07 # Storage Classes

    title: Data manipulation through object versioning
    description: |
      Attackers may manipulate object versioning to revert objects to older,
      vulnerable versions, introducing security flaws or malicious content.
    features:
      - CCC.ObjStor.F09 # Object Versioning
    mitre_technique:
      - T1027 # Obfuscated Files or Information
      - T1485 # Data Destruction

    title: Improper enforcement of object modification locks
    description: |
      Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in object modification locks to
      delete or alter objects despite the lock being in place, leading to data
      loss or tampering.
    features:
      - CCC.ObjStor.F10 # Object Modification Locks
    mitre_technique:
      - T1027 # Obfuscated Files or Information
      - T1485 # Data Destruction

  - id: CCC.ObjStor.TH08
    title: Event notification interception
    description: |
      Malicious actors may exploit event notifications to monitor and intercept
      information about sensitive operations or access patterns, leading to
      potential breaches of sensitive data.
    features:
      - CCC.F07 # Event Notifications

  - id: CCC.TH09
    title: Unauthorized object replication to untrusted or external locations
    description: |
      An attacker could replicate objects to untrusted or external locations if replication configurations 
      are not properly restricted. This could result in data leakage or exposure to unauthorized entities 
      outside the organization's trusted perimeter.
