    title: Attacker encrypts objects for ransomware
    description: The object storage service provides several types of encryption where the key is not operated by the CSP. An attacker can encrypt all the data stored in the bucket to ransom the data owner to get the decryption key. Alternatively, an attacker can change the default encryption key, for a similar effect on any new data uploaded.

    title: Attacker grants bucket access to untrusted principals
    description: The bucket access controls (e.g. ACLs, bucket policies) can enable access to objects owned by the bucket. An attacker (or someone by negligence) can change (i.e., impair) the bucket access controls and make the content accessible to untrusted principals (via public endpoints, cross-account VPC endpoints, or cross-account access point).
