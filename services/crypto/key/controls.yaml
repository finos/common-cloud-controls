        objective: >
          Generate near-real-time alerts when a KMS key version is disabled or
          scheduled for deletion, enabling rapid investigation and recovery.

              When a key version is scheduled for deletion or disabled, an
              alert MUST be generated within five minutes.

            recommendation: Use native event services (e.g., CloudWatch Events,
              Azure Monitor, Cloud Audit Logs) to route notifications to an
              incident-response channel.
