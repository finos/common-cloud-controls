    title: Deletion, disabling or preventing access to KMS key versions
    description: |
      An attacker with access to the KMS service can delete, disable or prevent access to key versions that are used 
      to encrypt or decrypt sensitive data. This can result in a denial of service by preventing 
      data decryption or, in some cases, lead to permanent data destruction.

    title: Exposure of KMS key outside of a defined identity and network perimeter
    description: |
      An attacker who gains unauthorized access to a KMS key outside the trusted identity and network perimeter 
      can use the key to decrypt sensitive data, compromising confidentiality. For example, public exposure of 
      the KMS key allows attackers to decrypt stored data.
