    title: Deletion or disabling of KMS key versions leading to denial of service or data destruction
    description: |
      An attacker with access to the KMS service can delete or disable key versions that are used
      to encrypt or decrypt sensitive data. This can result in a denial of service by preventing
      data decryption or, in some cases, lead to permanent data destruction.
