        title: Password Management
        objective: |
          Ensure default vendor-supplied DB administrator credentials are replaced
          with strong, unique passwords and that these credentials are properly
          managed using a secure password or secrets management solution.

              When an attempt is made to authenticate to the database using known
              default credentials, the authentication attempt must fail and no
              access should be granted.

        title: Account Lockout and Rate-Limiting
        objective: |
          Ensure the database enforces lockouts or rate-limiting after a specified
          number of failed authentication attempts. This prevents brute force
          or password-guessing attacks from succeeding.

              When repeated failed login attempts are made in a short timeframe,
              the account must be locked out or rate-limited to prevent
              further login attempts.

        title: Access Control for Backup and Restore Operations

          Restrict who can initiate, manage, and validate database backup or
          restore operations through strict role-based or least-privilege
          access. Prevents accidental or malicious restorations, protecting
          data integrity and availability.

              When there is an attempt to perform a backup or restore,

              backup/restore functions.

        title: Enforce and Monitor Automated Backups
        objective: |
          Ensure database backups are automatically scheduled, actively monitored,
          and promptly reported if any disruptions occur. This helps maintain
          data integrity, facilitates disaster recovery, and supports business
          continuity when a system failure or breach occurs.
