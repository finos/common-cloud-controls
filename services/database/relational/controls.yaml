    title: Password Management
    objective: |
      Ensure default vendor-supplied DB administrator credentials are replaced
      with strong, unique passwords and that these credentials are properly
      managed using a secure password or secrets management solution.

          When an attempt is made to authenticate to the database using known
          default credentials, the authentication attempt must fail and no
          access should be granted.

    title: Account Lockout and Rate-Limiting
    objective: |
      Ensure the database enforces lockouts or rate-limiting after a specified
      number of failed authentication attempts. This prevents brute force
      or password-guessing attacks from succeeding.

    title: Enforce and Monitor Automated Backups
    objective: |
      Ensure database backups are automatically scheduled, actively monitored,
      and promptly reported if any disruptions occur. This helps maintain
      data integrity, facilitates disaster recovery, and supports business
      continuity when a system failure or breach occurs.

    title: Access Control for Backup and Restore Operations
    objective: |
      Restrict who can initiate, manage, and validate database backup or
      restore operations through strict role-based or least-privilege
      access. Prevents accidental or malicious restorations, protecting
      data integrity and availability.

          backup/restore functions.

      Ensure database snapshots can only be shared with explicitly authorized
      accounts, thereby minimizing the risk of data exposure or exfiltration.
