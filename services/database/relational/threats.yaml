    title: Unauthorized Cross-Organization Snapshot Collection
    description: |
      Unauthorized snapshot collection using privileged roles may
      result in sensitive data being copied outside the organizationâ€™s
      environment. This condition could lead to unintended data
      exposure and compromise of organizational information.

    title: Disabled Logging and Monitoring
    description: |
      The logging and monitoring of a relational database may be disabled,
      potentially hindering the detection of security events and reducing
      visibility into system activities. This condition can impact the
      organization's ability to investigate incidents and maintain operational
      integrity.

    title: Unencrypted Connection to Database
    description: |
      Establishing a connection to a database over an unencrypted protocol,
      such as HTTP, may expose data to interception and unauthorized access
      during transmission. This condition increases the risk of data compromise
      through network eavesdropping.

    title: Unintentional Database Backup Restoration
    description: |
      A database backup may be restored unintentionally, potentially
      leading to the loss or overwrite of current data. This condition
      could disrupt operations and result in data inconsistency or
      corruption.

    title: Brute Force Attempts on Database Authentication
    description: |
      Repeated attempts to guess database user passwords may be made
      through brute force techniques. This condition could result in
      unauthorized access if successful, compromising database security
      and sensitive information.
