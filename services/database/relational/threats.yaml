    title: Unauthorized Access via Default Credentials
    description: |
      If default credentials are not disabled or changed, unauthorized access
      may be gained to the RDMS environment. This may lead to data breaches,
      data manipulation, or overall compromise of the database instance.

    title: Brute Force Attempts on Database Authentication
    description: |
      Repeated attempts to guess database user passwords may be made
      through brute force techniques. This condition could result in
      unauthorized access if successful, compromising database security
      and sensitive information.

    title: Database Backups Stopped
    description: |
      Database backups may be halted, potentially impairing the organization's
      ability to recover data and maintain business continuity. This condition
      increases the risk of data loss and extended system downtime.

    title: Unintentional Database Backup Restoration
    description: |
      A database backup may be restored unintentionally, potentially
      leading to the loss or overwrite of current data. This condition
      could disrupt operations and result in data inconsistency or
      corruption.

    title: Unauthorized Snapshot Sharing
    description: |
      Snapshots may be shared with untrusted accounts, which can lead to
      unauthorized access and potential data exfiltration. This significantly
      increases the risk of data exposure if sensitive information is contained
      in the snapshots.
