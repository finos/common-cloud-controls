    title: Unauthorized Cross-Organization Snapshot Collection
    description: |
      Unauthorized snapshot collection using privileged roles may
      result in sensitive data being copied outside the organization’s
      environment. This condition could lead to unintended data
      exposure and compromise of organizational information.

    title: Disabled Logging and Monitoring #TODO: why is this not a commmon threat?
    description: |
      The logging and monitoring of a relational database may be disabled,
      potentially hindering the detection of security events and reducing
      visibility into system activities. This condition can impact the
      organization's ability to investigate incidents and maintain operational
      integrity.
