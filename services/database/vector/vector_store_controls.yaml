    title: Validate Embeddings Before Indexing
    objective: Ensure all incoming embeddings are structurally and statistically validated
      before indexing to prevent poisoning or corruption.
    assessment-requirements:
    - id: CCC.Vector.C01.TR01
      text: When a vector embedding is submitted for indexing, the system MUST validate
        that it matches expected schema, dimension, and format profiles.

    title: Enforce Role-Based Index Lifecycle Management
    objective: Restrict index lifecycle operations (create, delete, rollback) to privileged
      identities using fine-grained access controls.
    assessment-requirements:
    - id: CCC.Vector.C02.TR01
      text: When an index lifecycle event is triggered, the service MUST verify that
        the actor has explicit permissions for the operation type.

    title: Enforce Metadata-Level Access Controls
    objective: Apply access control policies to metadata fields used in filtering
      to prevent unauthorized exposure or inference.
    assessment-requirements:
    - id: CCC.Vector.C03.TR01
      text: When a metadata filter is applied to a query, the service MUST verify
        the requester is authorized to access that field.

    title: Enforce Ingestion Quotas and Throttling
    objective: Prevent ingestion-based DoS or index pollution by rate-limiting vector
      submissions and enforcing quotas.
    assessment-requirements:
    - id: CCC.Vector.C04.TR01
      text: When ingestion exceeds pre-defined thresholds, the service MUST throttle
        or reject excess vector write operations.

    title: Enforce Index Versioning with Rollback Protection
    objective: Ensure vector indexes are versioned and that rollback operations are
      authorized and auditable.
    assessment-requirements:
    - id: CCC.Vector.C05.TR01
      text: When a rollback is attempted, the system MUST log the action and verify
        rollback authorization.

    title: Enforce Dimensional and Format Constraints
    objective: Reject embeddings that do not conform to expected model specifications
      (dimensions, format, etc).
    assessment-requirements:
    - id: CCC.Vector.C06.TR01
      text: When an embedding is submitted, the service MUST validate that its format
        and dimensionality match allowed profiles.

    title: Support Explicit ANN vs. Exact Search Configuration
    objective: Provide clients with the option to enforce exact-match (non-ANN) search
      where search fidelity is critical.
    assessment-requirements:
    - id: CCC.Vector.C07.TR01
      text: When a search request is issued, clients MUST be allowed to declare their
        requirement for exact vs approximate results.
