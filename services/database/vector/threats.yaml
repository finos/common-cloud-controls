  title: Embedding Extraction and Model Inversion
  description: Attackers may infer or reconstruct original data by probing vector
    similarity APIs, especially with unrestricted access. This enables model inversion
    attacks, membership inference, and unauthorized data leakage from stored embeddings.

- id: CCC.Vector.TH02
  title: Embedding and Index Poisoning
  description: Adversaries may insert malicious or adversarial vectors into the index
    through ingestion endpoints, polluting the dataset and degrading search quality,
    or subtly steering results toward specific outcomes.

    identifiers:
    - AIR-SEC-009
- id: CCC.Vector.TH03
  title: Cross-modal or Metadata Leakage
  description: Attackers may infer sensitive information through metadata filters
    or by correlating embeddings across modalities (e.g., voice and face), bypassing
    surface-level access controls.

  title: Denial of Service via Query or Ingestion Flooding
  description: High-volume ingestion or excessive low-latency similarity queries can
    overwhelm vector indexing services, degrading performance for legitimate users
    and potentially exhausting system resources.

  - reference-id: CCC
    identifiers:
    - CCC.Vector.F05
    - CCC.Vector.F06
- id: CCC.Vector.TH05
  title: Index Corruption or Downgrade
  description: Attackers with unauthorized access or excessive permissions may tamper
    with or roll back index versions, potentially restoring poisoned data or breaking
    downstream integrations.

  - reference-id: CCC
    identifiers:
    - CCC.Vector.F07
    - CCC.Vector.F11
- id: CCC.Vector.TH06
  title: Embedding Format or Dimension Attacks
  description: Poor validation of embedding formats or dimensions can cause service
    crashes or logic errors. This can result in denial of service or incorrect similarity
    results.

    - CCC.Vector.F08
    - CCC.Vector.F09
- id: CCC.Vector.TH07
  title: Search Result Manipulation via ANN Bias
  description: Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms may yield non-deterministic
    or biased results. Adversaries may exploit these differences to evade detection
    or bias AI responses.

  - reference-id: CCC
    identifiers:
    - CCC.Vector.F12
