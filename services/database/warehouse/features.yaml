    description: |
      Ability to store results of a query into physical tables for faster
      data retrieval and improved query performance for complex queries.

  - id: CCC.DataWar.F09
    title: Column-Level Security
    description: |
      Allows setting access policies at the column level to
      restrict access to sensitive data fields within tables.

  - id: CCC.DataWar.F10
    title: Row-Level Security
    description: |
      Enables setting access policies at the row level to
      control access to subsets of data within a table based
      on user roles.

  - id: CCC.DataWar.F11
    title: Integration with Data Sources
    description: |
      Seamless integration with various data sources such as object
      storage, relational and non-relational databases, data streams
      and data lakes.

  - id: CCC.DataWar.F12
    title: Integration with ETL
    description: |
      Integration with services that perform extract, transform and
      load data from various sources into the data warehouse. Unstructured
      data in transformed to structured or semi-structured data before
      ingestion to the data warehouse using ETL tools.

  - id: CCC.DataWar.F13
    title: Integration with ML
    description: |
      Build-in integration with machine learning services for enhanced
      processing of large volumes of complex data with ML models for
      predictive analytics, automated insights and more. ML can be used
      in data cleansing and transformation for improved data quality as well.

  - id: CCC.DataWar.F14
    title: Real-time Monitoring
    description: |
      Ability to continuously track and analyze data as it is ingested,
      processed and stored to ensure data quality, operational efficiency,
      scalability and security.

  - id: CCC.DataWar.F16
    title: View Creation and Access
    description: |
      Supports the creation of views (can be logical or material) to abstract
      and simplify access to underlying data. Views can be created with custom
      queries to expose subsets of data. These views are accessible by users
      and applications with appropriate permissions.
