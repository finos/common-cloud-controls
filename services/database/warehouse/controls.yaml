        title: Enforce Use of Managed Views for Data Access
        objective: |
          Ensure that data access is provided through managed views, restricting users
          from accessing underlying tables directly and enforcing consistent security policies.
        requirements:
          - id: CCC.DataWar.C01.TR01
            text: |
              Attempt to access underlying database tables directly without
              using managed views and verify that access is denied.
