    title: Valid Cloud Credentials Abuse
    description: |
      Valid identity credentials such as access keys, tokens or passwords are misused or
      compromised. Examples include public exposure, token theft, unprotected
      metadata service of a compromised compute instance or brute-force attacks.
      The use of these credentials can provide unauthorized access to the cloud environment,
      potentially bypassing other security controls and enabling lateral movement across
      cloud resources.

    title: Overly-Permissive IAM Policy
    description: |
      An access control policy attached to an identity or a resource is
      configured with excessive permissions, violating the principle of least privilege.
      This can enable unauthorized data access, privilege escalation, or other unintended
      actions by principals whose credentials might be compromised or who are acting erroneously.

    title: Overly-Permissive Identity Trust Policy
    description: |
      An IAM role or service principal's trust policy is configured to allow principals
      from untrusted or overly broad scopes, such as any identity in any account, to assume
      or impersonate it. This can allow an external or unauthorized identity to gain access
      to the cloud environment, completely bypassing internal identity controls.

    title: Identity Inherits Excessive Permissions Through Group Membership
    description: |
      An identity principal becomes a member of one or more IAM groups, and the combined
      policies of these groups grant permissions beyond what is necessary for the principal's
      function. This "privilege creep" through group inheritance complicates auditing and can
      lead to an identity having standing access to sensitive resources.

    title: Privilege Escalation via Indirect Role Usage
    description: |
      An identity principal possesses specific, highly privileged permissions, such as the
      ability to pass roles or impersonate service accounts, that allow it to leverage
      the permissions of a different, more privileged role. Even without being able
      to directly assume the target role, the principal can attach it to a new resource
      they control and then use that resource to perform unauthorized actions.

    title: Long-Lived Static Credentials
    description: |
      Long-lived static credentials such as access keys for an identity are used and

    title: Orphaned Federated Identity Retains Access
    description: |
      A federated identity is de-provisioned from the external Identity Provider (IdP),
      but its corresponding cloud identity remains active within the cloud environment.
      This orphaned identity creates a latent access path that could be exploited if the
      original username is reactivated or reassigned in the IdP, granting unintended
      access to a new principal.

    title: IAM Role is Coerced into Unauthorized Cross-Account Actions (Confused Deputy)
    description: |
      An external actor tricks a legitimate, authorized third-party application into making requests
      to the cloud environment. A role in the cloud account (the "deputy"), which trusts that third-party
      application, then performs unauthorized actions on behalf of the actor.
