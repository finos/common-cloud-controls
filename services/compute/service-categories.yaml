description: |
  Compute services in the context of cloud computing refer to the resources and
  capabilities provided by cloud service providers to run and manage
  applications, workloads, and virtualized computing environments in a
  scalable, flexible, and cost-effective manner. These services enable users to
  provision, configure, and manage virtual servers, containers, serverless
  functions, and other computing resources without the need for physical
  hardware procurement or management.

    title: Virtual Machines (VMs)
    description: |
      Virtual machines are virtualized instances of computer hardware that
      emulate physical servers and run operating systems and applications.
      Users can provision VMs with custom configurations, including CPU,
      memory, storage, and networking resources. Cloud providers offer managed
      VM services with features such as automated provisioning, scaling,
      monitoring, and pay-as-you-go pricing.
    examples:
      - AWS:
          - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
      - Azure:
          - Virtual Machines
      - Google Cloud:
          - Compute Engine

    title: Containers
    description: |
      Containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments that
      package applications and their dependencies for deployment across
      different computing environments. Container services provide
      orchestration, management, and scaling capabilities for containerized
      workloads using platforms such as Docker and Kubernetes. Cloud providers
      offer managed container services with features such as container
      registry, cluster management, and auto-scaling.
    examples:
      - AWS:
          - Elastic Container Service (ECS)
          - Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
      - Azure:
          - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
      - Google Cloud:
          - Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

    title: Serverless Computing
    description: |
      Serverless computing, also known as Function as a Service (FaaS), allows
      users to deploy and run code functions without provisioning or managing
      servers. Cloud providers abstract infrastructure management tasks, such
      as server provisioning, scaling, and maintenance, enabling users to focus
      on writing and deploying code. Serverless services automatically scale
      based on demand and bill users only for the resources consumed during
      function execution.
    examples:
      - AWS:
          - AWS Lambda
      - Azure:
          - Azure Functions
      - Google Cloud:
          - Cloud Functions

    title: Batch Processing
    description: |
      Batch processing services enable users to execute large-scale,
      parallelizable computing tasks, such as data processing, analytics, and
      batch jobs. These services automatically allocate and manage compute
      resources to execute batch jobs efficiently and cost-effectively. Users
      can specify job requirements, dependencies, and scheduling preferences
      to optimize job execution.
    examples:
      - AWS:
          - AWS Batch
      - Azure:
          - Azure Batch
      - Google Cloud:
          - Cloud Dataflow

    title: Edge Computing
    description: |
      Edge computing services extend cloud computing capabilities to the
      network edge, closer to end-users and devices, to reduce latency,
      improve performance, and enable real-time data processing and analytics.
      Edge computing services provide compute, storage, and networking
      resources at edge locations, such as IoT devices, edge servers, and
      network appliances.
    examples:
      - AWS:
          - AWS IoT Greengrass and AWS Outposts
      - Azure:
          - Azure IoT Edge
      - Google Cloud:
          - Google Cloud IoT Edge
