  - id: CCC.SvlsComp.C01 # Enforce Virtual Network Integration for Serverless Function
    title: Enforce Virtual Private Network Integration for Serverless Function
    objective: |
      Ensure that the serverless function is integrated with a virtual private network, allowing it to access resources securely within the network and preventing unauthorized external access.
    control_family: Network Security
    threats:
      - CCC.TH01 # Access control is misconfigured
    nist_csf: PR.AC-5 # Network integrity is protected

        - SC-7 # Boundary Protection

        text: |
          Attempt to access the serverless function from outside the virtual private network and verify that access is denied.

  - id: CCC.SvlsComp.C02 # Implement Function Invocation Rate Limits
    title: Implement Function Invocation Rate Limits
    objective: |
      Ensure that function invocation is limited to a specified threshold from any single entity, preventing resource exhaustion and denial of service attacks.
    control_family: Availability
    threats:
      - CCC.TH12 # Resource constraints are exhausted

          Send requests to invoke the function up to the allowed threshold and confirm they are successful; then send additional requests exceeding the threshold from the same entity and verify that they are denied.
