    title: Event Driven Execution
    description: |
      Supports execution of code functions in response to events
      without the need to manage underlying server infrastructure.

  - id: CCC.SvlsComp.F02
    title: Event Triggers
    description: |
      Ability to configure event triggers for functions such as
      HTTP requests, cloud storage changes, messaging services,
      and schedules.

  - id: CCC.SvlsComp.F03
    title: Stateless Architecture
    description: |
      Functions are stateless and do not retain data or state
      between invocations.

  - id: CCC.SvlsComp.F04
    title: Cold Start
    description: |
      New execution environment is created and initialized to process

  - id: CCC.SvlsComp.F05
    title: Warm Start
    description: |
      Ability to reuse of an already-initialized execution environment to
      handle subsequent requests, to reduce invocation latency

  - id: CCC.SvlsComp.F06

      configuration settings and operational parameters.

  - id: CCC.SvlsComp.F14
    title: Aliases
    description: |
      Support the use of aliases such as dev, test, prod to manage

      modifying the function's code.

  - id: CCC.SvlsComp.F15
    title: Container Image Support
    description: |
