      Instance templates may contain hardcoded credentials, open ports, or
      insecure configurations. When reused across deployments, these templates
      can replicate vulnerabilities at scale.

    title: Network Access Rules Allow Unintended Communication
    description: |
      Inadequately scoped network access rules may permit communication between
      virtual machines and untrusted networks or services, increasing exposure
      to unauthorized access and lateral movement.

    title: Remote Access Interfaces Are Insufficiently Restricted
    description: |
      Virtual machine instances may expose remote access methods such as SSH or
      RDP without proper access controls or network restrictions, allowing
      unintended access to administrative interfaces.

    title: Resource Starvation Through Preemptible (spot) VM Termination
    description: |
      Workloads running on preemptible (spot) instances may experience unexpected termination
      by the cloud provider with minimal notice. This can result in workload instability, leading
      to service degradation or denial-of-service if critical processes are scheduled on such VMs,
      potentially impacting system reliability and availability.

    title: Co-Residency Risk on Non-Dedicated Infrastructure
    description: |
      Virtual machines operating on shared infrastructure, rather than dedicated instances, may be
      exposed to increased risk of side-channel or cross-VM activities. This can result in data
      leakage or memory scraping, potentially compromising data confidentiality and system integrity.

    title: Misconfigured Vertical Scaling Leads to Privilege Escalation
    description: |
      Inadequate permissions or automation logic in vertical scaling processes may allow unauthorized
      resource escalation, such as adding CPUs or memory. This can result in elevated access rights,
      increased computational capacity for unintended actions, or unplanned cost increases, potentially
      affecting system security and operational control.

    title: Auto-Scaling Abuse for Resource Exhaustion
    description: |
      Automated horizontal scaling mechanisms may be manipulated through forced load generation, such
      as distributed denial-of-service events, triggering excessive VM creation. This can lead to
      billing anomalies, service instability, or disruption of resource quotas, potentially impacting
      cost management and service availability.
