  description: |
    Log Storage services provide scalable, durable, and secure infrastructure for the 
    ingestion, storage, and retention of log and trace data generated by distributed systems. 
    These services are optimized for handling high-throughput, time-series, semi-structured data 
    with support for customizable retention, indexing, tagging, and compliance-oriented access controls.
    Log storage underpins observability, auditing, and regulatory use cases by enabling reliable 
    persistence and retrieval of critical system events and trace spans.
