# Database Services

Database services in the context of cloud computing refer to managed database solutions provided by cloud service providers. These services enable users to store, manage, and access structured data in a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective manner.

## Types of Database Services

- [Relational Databases](#relational-databases)
- [NoSQL Databases](#nosql-databases)
- [In-Memory Databases](#in-memory-databases)
- Graph Databases <!-- TODO -->
- [Data Warehousing](#data-warehousing)

### Relational Databases

Relational database services support structured data models and SQL (Structured Query Language) for data definition, manipulation, and querying.

Examples:

- **AWS**: Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and MariaDB
- **Azure**: Google Cloud SQL for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server
- **Google Cloud**: Azure SQL Database for SQL Server

### NoSQL Databases

NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases support flexible, schema-less data models and are suitable for semi-structured or unstructured data.

Examples:

- **AWS**: Amazon DynamoDB
- **Azure**: Azure Cosmos DB
- **Google Cloud**: Google Cloud Firestore and Cloud Bigtable

### In-Memory Databases

In-memory database services store data in memory for faster read and write operations, making them ideal for high-performance applications.

Examples:

- **AWS**: Amazon ElastiCache for Redis or Memcached
- **Azure**: Azure Cache for Redis.
- **Google Cloud**: Google Cloud Memorystore for Redis

### Data Warehousing

Data warehousing services enable users to store and analyze large volumes of structured data for business intelligence and analytics purposes.

Examples:

- **AWS**: Amazon Redshift
- **Azure**: Azure Synapse Analytics
- **Google Cloud**: Google BigQuery
