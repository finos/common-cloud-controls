# Storage Services

"Storage Services" in the context of cloud computing refer to the provision of storage resources over the internet that users can access and utilize remotely. These services allow users to store, retrieve, and manage their data in a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective manner.

## Types of Storage Services

- [Object Storage](#object-storage)
- [Block Storage](#block-storage)
- [File Storage](#file-storage)
- [Archival Storage](#archival-storage)

### Object Storage

Object storage is a scalable storage solution that stores data as objects, each containing the data itself along with metadata and a unique identifier.

Examples:

- **AWS**: Amazon S3
- **Azure**: Azure Blob Storage
- **Google Cloud**: Google Cloud Storage

### Block Storage

Block storage provides raw storage volumes that can be attached to virtual machines to store operating systems, applications, and other data.

Examples:

- **AWS**: Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)
- **Azure**: Azure Managed Disks
- **Google Cloud**: Google Persistent Disk

### File Storage

File storage services offer shared network storage accessible via standard file protocols such as NFS (Network File System) or SMB (Server Message Block)

Examples:

- **AWS**: Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)
- **Azure**: Azure File Storage
- **Google Cloud**: Google Cloud Filestore

### Archival Storage

Archival storage services are designed for long-term retention of infrequently accessed data at a lower cost.

Examples:

- **AWS**: Amazon Glacier
- **Azure**: Azure Archive Storage
- **Google Cloud**: Google Cloud Storage Nearline
