    title: Health Checks Used to Identify Attack Targets
    description: |
      Health Checks are used to inform those responsible for maintaining a system that
      there is a problem, but if that information gets into the hands of a malicious
      actor, it can be used to target already problematic systems and mask malicious activity.

    title: External Monitoring DoS
    description: |
      If an external monitoring service is compromised, it can act as a host for

      not be protected against this form of attack.

    title: External Monitoring Access
    description: |
      If an external monitoring system is compromised, it acts as a trusted external
      remote service and can then access internal services which would otherwise not
      be accessible directly.

    title: Data Exfiltration Through Tampered Metrics
    description: |
      If a malicious actor is able to make changes to the metrics being collected, it could
      be used to encrypt and or compress sensitive data and bypass controls preventing
      exfiltration. The data can then be staged in the monitoring system and exfiltrated in
      bulk at a later point in time

    title: Cost Exhaustion Through Tampered Alerts or Metrics Collection
    description: |
      Monitoring systems are expected to generate traffic, but it a malicious actor were to
      change alerts that were being fired at an API which charged per requests or generate
      large volumes of metric data which would then need to be stored and processed, or even
      triggering resource scaling, this would cause an increase in cloud bill.

      metric data to trigger malicious actions and re-compromise a newly replaced container
      or compute instance.
