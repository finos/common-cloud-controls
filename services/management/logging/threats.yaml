    title: Log Ingestion Performance Degradation
    description: |
      The logging service's ingestion pipeline experiences performance
      degradation due to overwhelming log volumes, network bottlenecks, or
      inefficient processing, leading to delayed availability of log data for
      analysis and potential log loss if buffers overflow.

    title: Unauthorized Data Transfer Out of a Trusted Boundary
    description: |
      Sensitive log data, including PII, financial transaction details,
      or system vulnerabilities, is exfiltrated directly from the
      logging service's query or API interfaces by authorized but malicious
      insiders or compromised accounts exploiting legitimate access.

    title: Log Schema or Format Drift
    description: |
      Changes in source application or cloud service log formats, schemas,
      or underlying data structures lead to parsing failures, incomplete
      log ingestion, or render existing queries and dashboards ineffective,
      hindering comprehensive analysis.

    title: Inadequate Log Anonymization/Masking
    description: |
      Sensitive data (e.g., PII, secrets, authentication tokens) is ingested
      into logs without proper anonymization, masking, or redaction at source
      or during ingestion. This creates a significant data exposure risk,
      particularly for data not intended for broad log access.

    title: Log Retention Policy Evasion or Misconfiguration
    description: |
      Log data is deleted prematurely or retained longer than legally required
      due to misconfigured retention policies, manual overrides, or evasion
      tactics. This can lead to non-compliance with regulatory requirements
      or loss of critical forensic evidence.

    title: Log Injection
    description: |
      User-supplied data such as scripts, control characters, escape sequences,
      or code fragments may be written to logs without proper encoding or sanitization.
      This can result in malformed or unexpected log entries that could disrupt or
      compromise systems that process or display these logs, including log viewers
      or downstream services.
