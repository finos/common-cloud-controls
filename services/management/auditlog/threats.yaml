    title: Insufficient Audit Logs
    description: |
      If security critical audit events are not logged then it increases the difficulty to detect threats
      and perform post incident analysis.

    title: Log Ingestion Latency
    description: |
      Large spikes or sustained delays in log ingestion may degrade the timeliness and completeness of security telemetry. 
      This can increase the time required to detect and investigate threats, 
      potentially impacting incident response effectiveness.

    title: Sensitive Data Logged
    description: |
      Sensitive information such as  passwords, environment variables, or personally identifiable information (PII) 
      may be included in audit logs due to a number of reasons such as; 
      end user human error, developers not sanitizing fields or
      maliciously by a threat actor attempting to exfil data.
      This can lead to unauthorized disclosure if logs are accessed by unintended parties or forwarded to external systems.

    title: Insufficient encoding of audit logs
    description: |
      User-supplied malicious data such as; scripts, code, ASNI escape sequences,
      Unicode escape characters and CRLF injection can be included in Audit Logs.
      If not correctly encoded or sanitized then the unexpected log entries can be used
      as part of a exploit attack chain to effect a service upstream reading the audit logs.
