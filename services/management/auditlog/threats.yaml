    title: Insufficient Audit Logs
    description: |
      If security critical audit events are not logged then it increases the difficulty to detect threats
      and perform post incident analysis.

    title: Log Ingestion Latency
    description: |
      Large spikes or sustained delays in log ingestion may degrade the timeliness
      and completeness of security telemetry.
      This can increase the time required to detect and investigate threats,
      potentially impacting incident response effectiveness.

    title: Sensitive Data Logged
    description: |
      Sensitive information such as  passwords, environment variables,
      or personally identifiable information (PII)
      may be included in audit logs due to a number of reasons such as;
      end user human error, developers not sanitizing fields or
      maliciously by a threat actor attempting to exfil data.
      This can lead to unauthorized disclosure if logs are accessed by
      unintended parties or forwarded to external systems.

    title: Insufficient encoding of audit logs
    description: |
      User-supplied data such as scripts, control characters, escape sequences, or code fragments
      may be written to audit logs without proper encoding or sanitization. This can result in malformed
      or unexpected log entries that could disrupt or compromise systems that process or display these logs,
      including log viewers or downstream services.

    title: Logging Evasion via violating size constraints
    description: |
      An attacker can evade detection by intentionally crafting input that violates
      the size constraints of a clouds audit logging mechanism.
      Many systems impose a maximum size limit on individual log entries.
      By performing an action with oversized data such as whitespace or Unicode injection,
      the resulting log event, which often includes the offending data,
      exceeds this limit, which often is redacted in the audit logs.
