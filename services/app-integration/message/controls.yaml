        title: Use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for Messages
        objective: |
          Ensure that messages are encrypted using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)
          to provide enhanced control over encryption processes and keys, meeting compliance and security requirements.
