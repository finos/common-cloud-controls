        title: Use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for Messages
        objective: |
          Ensure that messages are encrypted using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)
          to provide enhanced control over encryption processes and keys, meeting compliance and security requirements.

              Attempt to publish a message without using a customer-managed encryption key
              and verify that the message is rejected or not stored.
