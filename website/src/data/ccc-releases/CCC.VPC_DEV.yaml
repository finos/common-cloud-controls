              When a port is exposed for non-SSH network traffic, all traffic

              Most cloud services enable TLS 1.3 by default. Where it is not
              already set, ensure that your services are configured or updated

              Review firewall, load balancer, and application configurations to

              exposed. Where possible, implement automatic redirection to secure
              protocols such as HTTPS, SFTP, SSH, and regularly scan for
              protocol drift.

      Tampering or deletion of service logs will reduce the system's ability to
      maintain an accurate record of events. Any actions that compromise the
      integrity of logs could disrupt system availability by disrupting
      monitoring, hindering forensic investigations, and reducing the accuracy
      of audit trails.

    description: |
      When resource tags are altered, it can lead to misclassification or
