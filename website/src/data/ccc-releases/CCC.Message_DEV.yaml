      The Data control family ensures the confidentiality, integrity,
      availability, and sovereignty of data across its lifecycle.
      These controls govern how data is transmitted, stored,
      replicated, and protected from unauthorized access, tampering,
      or exposure beyond defined trust perimeters.

              When a port is exposed for non-SSH network traffic, all traffic

              Most cloud services enable TLS 1.3 by default. Where it is not
              already set, ensure that your services are configured or updated

              Review firewall, load balancer, and application configurations to
              ensure insecure protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and Telnet are not
              exposed. Where possible, implement automatic redirection to secure
              protocols such as HTTPS, SFTP, SSH, and regularly scan for
              protocol drift.

              other, is run on that port.

              Reference the IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number
              Registry for more information about correct protocol-to-port
              assignments. Avoid running non-standard services on well-known

            recommendation: |
              Configure mTLS for all endpoints that process or transmit
              sensitive data. Ensure both client and server certificates are
              validated and managed securely. Regularly review certificate
              authorities and automate certificate rotation where possible.

    title: Runtime Metrics are Manipulated
    description: |
      Manipulation of runtime metrics can lead to inaccurate representations of
      system performance and resource utilization. This compromised data
      integrity may also impact system availability through misinformed scaling
      decisions, budget exhaustion, financial losses, and hindered incident
      detection.

      Exceeding the resource constraints through excessive consumption,

      This may disrupt availability of the service or child resources by
      denying the associated functionality to users. If the impacted system is
      not designed to expect such a failure, the effect could also cascade to
      other services and resources.
