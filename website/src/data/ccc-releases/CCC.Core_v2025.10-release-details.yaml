      This initial release of the FINOS CCC Core Catalog marks a shift
      toward increased reusability of controls across the broader CCC
      catalog ecosystem. In this new approach, catalogs can now provide
      users with increased consistency by maintaining core controls
      independently of each isolated catalog release.
  change-log:
    - Initial release of CCC.Core as a standalone catalog
