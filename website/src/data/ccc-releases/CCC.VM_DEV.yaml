      These controls govern how data is transmitted, stored,
      replicated, and protected from unauthorized access, tampering,
      or exposure beyond defined trust perimeters.

    title: Logs are Tampered With or Deleted
    description: |
      Tampering or deletion of service logs will reduce the system's ability to
      maintain an accurate record of events. Any actions that compromise the
      integrity of logs could disrupt system availability by disrupting
      monitoring, hindering forensic investigations, and reducing the accuracy
      of audit trails.
