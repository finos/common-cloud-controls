  title: CCC Managed Vector Store
  description: |
    A Managed Vector Store is a specialized data service designed to store, index, and
    retrieve high-dimensional vector embeddings, enabling similarity search and machine
    learning inference. These services are used in AI/ML pipelines for use cases such as
    semantic search, recommendation systems, and generative AI applications. Vector
    stores support operations like nearest neighbor search using approximate or exact
    methods and integrate with model-serving and ingestion pipelines. They are
    optimized for performance, scale, and integration with cloud-native tools.

    title: Older Resource Versions are Used
    description: |
      Running older versions of child resources can expose the system to known
      vulnerabilities that have been addressed in more recent versions. If the
      version identifier is detected by an attacker, it may be possible to
      exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the confidentiality,
      integrity, or availability of the system and its data.

    title: Automated Enumeration and Reconnaissance by Non-human Entities
    description: |
      Automated processes may be used to gather details about service and
      child resource elements such as APIs, file systems, or directories.
      This information can reveal vulnerabilities, misconfigurations,
      and the network topology, which can be used to plan an attack against
      the system, the service, or its child resources.

    description: |
      Publication of events, metrics, and runtime logs may be disabled, leading
      to a lack of expected security and operational information being shared.
      This can impact system availability by delaying the detection of
      incidents while also impacting system design decisions and enforcement of
      operational thresholds, such as autoscaling or cost management.

    title: Responses are Generated for Unauthorized Requests
    description: |
      The service may generate responses to requests from unauthorized entities.
      This could lead to the exposure of system details, which may be used to
      plan an attack against the service, system, or network. Additionally,
      allocating resources to service the request could lead to a denial of
      service for legitimate users, leading to a loss of availability anywhere
      in the system.
