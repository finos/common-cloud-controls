    title: Access Control is Misconfigured
    description: |
      Misconfigured access controls may grant excessive privileges or fail to
      restrict unauthorized access to the service and its child resources.
      This could result in a loss of data confidentiality or tolerance of
      unauthorized actions which impact the integrity and availability of
      resources and data.
