  title: Tracing & Analysis
  description: |
    Tracing and analysis services enable deep observability into distributed applications by
    correlating, and analyzing trace and span data across microservices and infrastructure layers.
    These services facilitate root cause analysis, performance tuning, anomaly detection, and system mapping.
    Modern platforms offer AI/ML-powered insights, live debugging capabilities, and integration with metrics/logging
    to deliver holistic views into application behavior and health.
