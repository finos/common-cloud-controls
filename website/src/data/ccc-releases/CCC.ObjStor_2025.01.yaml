    title: CCC Object Storage
    id: CCC.ObjStor
    description: |
        Object storage is a data storage architecture that manages data as objects,
        rather than as files or blocks. Each object contains the data itself,
        metadata, and a unique identifier, making it ideal for storing large amounts
        of unstructured data such as multimedia files, backups, and archives. It is
        highly scalable and often used in cloud environments due to its flexibility
        and accessibility.

            summary: |
                This initial release is part of the first batch of control catalogs
                produced by the CCC. It is the result of thousands of hours dedicated to
                exploring different ways of working and collaborating, on top of time
                spent researching, writing, and reviewing the content. This marks a huge
                milestone for the CCC and the broader community as further releases will
                continue to build on this foundation. A huge thanks to everyone who has
                brought us to this point!

        during authentication to prevent unauthorized access. This may include
        something you know, something you have, or something you are. In the
        case of programattically accessible services, such as API endpoints, this
        includes a combination of API keys or tokens and network restrictions.

      description: |
        Attackers may tamper with or delete logs to cover their tracks and evade
        detection. This prevents security teams from identifying the full scope
        of an attack and may disrupt forensic investigations.

        Malicious actors may exploit event notifications to trigger sensitive
        operations or access patterns. Alternately, attackers may flood the
        system with notifications to obfuscate another attack or overwhelm the
        service to disrupt legitimate operations.

      title: Resource Constraints are Exhausted
      description: |
        An attack or misconfiguration can consume all available resources, such
        as memory, CPU, or storage, to disrupt the service or deny access to
        legitimate users. This can be achieved through repeated requests,
        resource-intensive operations, or the lowering of rate/budget limits.
        Through auto-scaling, the attacker may also attempt to exhaust
        higher-level budget thresholds to impact other systems in the same scope.

      title: Older Resource Versions are Exploited
      description: |
        Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in older versions of resources,
        taking advantage of deprecated or insecure configurations. Without
        proper version control and monitoring, outdated versions can be used
        to bypass security measures.

      title: Automated Enumeration and Reconnaissance by Non-human Entities
      description: |
        Attackers may deploy automated processes or bots to perform reconnaissance
        activities by enumerating resources such as APIs, file systems, or directories.
        These activities can help attackers identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations,
        or unsecured resources, which can then be exploited for unauthorized access
        or data theft.

        summary: |
            This initial release is part of the first batch of control catalogs
            produced by the CCC. It is the result of thousands of hours dedicated to
            exploring different ways of working and collaborating, on top of time
            spent researching, writing, and reviewing the content. This marks a huge
            milestone for the CCC and the broader community as further releases will
            continue to build on this foundation. A huge thanks to everyone who has
            brought us to this point!
