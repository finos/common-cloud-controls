            This initial release is part of the first batch of control catalogs
            produced by the CCC. It is the result of thousands of hours dedicated to
            exploring different ways of working and collaborating, on top of time
            spent researching, writing, and reviewing the content. This marks a huge
            milestone for the CCC and the broader community as further releases will
            continue to build on this foundation. A huge thanks to everyone who has
            brought us to this point!

          objective: |
            Ensure that all sensitive activities require two or more identity factors
            during authentication to prevent unauthorized access. This may include
            something you know, something you have, or something you are. In the
            case of programattically accessible services, such as API endpoints, this
            includes a combination of API keys or tokens and network restrictions.
