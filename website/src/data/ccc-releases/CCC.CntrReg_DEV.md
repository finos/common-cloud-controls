## Capabilities

The following capabilities are required to be present on a resource for it to be considered a CCC Container Registry service. Threats outlined later in this catalog are assesssed based on the presence of these capabilities.

- **CCC.CntrReg.F01: Image Storage**
  
  Ability to upload and securely store container images and image metadata.

- **CCC.CntrReg.F02: Private Repositories**
  
  Support for creating container image repositories that are restricted and only accessible by authorized users or services.

**Resource Constraints are Exhausted**

**Description:** Exceeding the resource constraints through excessive consumption,
resource-intensive operations, or lowering of rate-limit thresholds
can impact the availability of elements such as memory, CPU, or storage.
This may disrupt availability of the service or child resources by
denying the associated functionality to users. If the impacted system is
not designed to expect such a failure, the effect could also cascade to
other services and resources.

that are explicitly included within a defined trust perimeter.


| Assessment Requirement | Applicability |
| --- | --- |
| When data is replicated, the service MUST ensure that replication only occurs to destinations that are explicitly included within the defined trust perimeter. |tlp-green<br />tlp-amber<br />tlp-red<br /> |

**Prevent Access from Untrusted Entities**

**Objective:** Ensure that secure access controls enforce the principle of least
privilege to restrict access to authorized entities from explicitly
trusted sources only.


| Assessment Requirement | Applicability |
| --- | --- |
| When an attempt is made to modify data on the service or a child resource, the service MUST block requests from unauthorized entities. |tlp-clear<br />tlp-green<br />tlp-amber<br />tlp-red<br /> |
| When administrative access or configuration change is attempted on the service or a child resource, the service MUST refuse requests from unauthorized entities. |tlp-clear<br />tlp-green<br />tlp-amber<br />tlp-red<br /> |
| When administrative access or configuration change is attempted on the service or a child resource in a multi-tenant environment, the service MUST refuse requests across tenant boundaries unless the origin is explicitly included in a pre-approved allowlist. |tlp-clear<br />tlp-green<br />tlp-amber<br />tlp-red<br /> |
| When data is requested from outside the trust perimeter, the service MUST refuse requests from unauthorized entities. |tlp-amber<br />tlp-red<br /> |
| When any request is made from outside the trust perimeter, the service MUST NOT provide any response that may indicate the service exists. |tlp-red<br /> |
| When any request is made to the service or a child resource, the service MUST refuse requests from unauthorized entities. |tlp-green<br />tlp-amber<br />tlp-red<br /> |
