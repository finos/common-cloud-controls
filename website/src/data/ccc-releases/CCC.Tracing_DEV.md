# CCC.Tracing vDEV (Tracing &amp; Analysis)

Tracing and analysis services enable deep observability into distributed applications by
correlating, and analyzing trace and span data across microservices and infrastructure layers.
These services facilitate root cause analysis, performance tuning, anomaly detection, and system mapping.
Modern platforms offer AI/ML-powered insights, live debugging capabilities, and integration with metrics/logging
to deliver holistic views into application behavior and health.

## Capabilities

The following capabilities are required to be present on a resource for it to be considered a Tracing &amp; Analysis service. Threats outlined later in this catalog are assesssed based on the presence of these capabilities.

- **CCC.Tracing.F01: Distributed Trace Analysis**
  
  Analyses end-to-end traces across services.

- **CCC.Tracing.F02: Runtime Profiling**
  
  Analyses performance data such as CPU usage, memory allocation, or latency metrics alongside traces.

- **CCC.Tracing.F03: Anomaly Detection**
  
  Applies statistical techniques to detect performance anomalies or trace behavior outliers.

- **CCC.Tracing.F04: Dependency Mapping**
  
  Generates service maps from traces to visualize inter-service communication and bottlenecks.

- **CCC.Tracing.F05: Trace Filtering and Tagging**
  
  Supports filtering and search on traces using enriched metadata fields such as user ID, region, or status code.

## Threats

The following threats have been identified based upon Tracing &amp; Analysis service capabilities. Controls outlined later in this catalog are designed to mitigate these threats. If you are aware of threats to Tracing &amp; Analysis services that are not captured here, please refer to the Common Cloud Controls contributing guide for information about how you can help improve this catalog.

Below is a summary table of the identified threats, which is then followed by an elucidation of each threat and relevant mappings.

## Controls

The following controls have been designed to mitigate the aforementioned threats that have been identified for CCC.Tracing. Each control includes one or more Assessment Requirements that should always pass for a service to be considered compliant with this control catalog. If your experience can help improve these controls, please refer to the Common Cloud Controls contributing guide for information about how you can help improve this catalog.

Below is a summary table of the controls, which is then followed by an elucidation of each control and relevant mappings.
