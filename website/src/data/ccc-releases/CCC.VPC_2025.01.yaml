            summary: |
                This initial release is part of the first batch of control catalogs
                produced by the CCC. It is the result of thousands of hours dedicated to
                exploring different ways of working and collaborating, on top of time
                spent researching, writing, and reviewing the content. This marks a huge
                milestone for the CCC and the broader community as further releases will
                continue to build on this foundation. A huge thanks to everyone who has
                brought us to this point!

        during authentication to prevent unauthorized access. This may include
        something you know, something you have, or something you are. In the
        case of programattically accessible services, such as API endpoints, this
        includes a combination of API keys or tokens and network restrictions.

        Ensure that secure access controls prevent unauthorized access,
        mitigate risks of data exfiltration, and block misuse of services
        by adversaries. This includes restricting access based on trust
        criteria such as IP allowlists, domain restrictions, and tenant
        isolation.

      title: Cost Management Data is Manipulated
      description: |
        Attackers may manipulate cost management data to hide excessive resource
        consumption or to deceive users about resource usage. This could be used
        to exhaust budgets, cause financial losses, or evade detection of other attacks.

      title: Logs or Monitoring Data are Read by Unauthorized Users
      description: |
        Unauthorized access to logs or monitoring data can provide attackers with
        valuable information about the system's configuration, operations, and
        security mechanisms. This can be used to identify vulnerabilities, plan
        attacks, or evade detection.

      description: |
        Malicious actors may exploit event notifications to monitor and
        intercept information about sensitive operations or access patterns.

      title: Event Notifications are Incorrectly Triggered
      description: |
        Malicious actors may exploit event notifications to trigger sensitive
        operations or access patterns. Alternately, attackers may flood the
        system with notifications to obfuscate another attack or overwhelm the
        service to disrupt legitimate operations.

      title: Resource Constraints are Exhausted
      description: |
        An attack or misconfiguration can consume all available resources, such
        as memory, CPU, or storage, to disrupt the service or deny access to
        legitimate users. This can be achieved through repeated requests,
        resource-intensive operations, or the lowering of rate/budget limits.
        Through auto-scaling, the attacker may also attempt to exhaust
        higher-level budget thresholds to impact other systems in the same scope.

      title: Resource Tags are Manipulated
      description: |
        Attackers may manipulate resource tags to alter organizational policies,
        disrupt billing, or evade detection. This can result in mismanaged
        resources, unauthorized access, or financial abuse.

      title: Older Resource Versions are Exploited
      description: |
        Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in older versions of resources,
        taking advantage of deprecated or insecure configurations. Without
        proper version control and monitoring, outdated versions can be used
        to bypass security measures.

      title: Automated Enumeration and Reconnaissance by Non-human Entities
      description: |
        Attackers may deploy automated processes or bots to perform reconnaissance
        activities by enumerating resources such as APIs, file systems, or directories.
        These activities can help attackers identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations,
        or unsecured resources, which can then be exploited for unauthorized access
        or data theft.

      title: Exposure of Resources to Public Internet
      description: |
        Assignment of external IP addresses to resources exposes resources to the
        public internet, increasing the risk of attacks such as brute force,
        exploitation of vulnerabilities, or unauthorized access.

      title: Unauthorized Network Access Through VPC Peering
      description: |
        Unauthorized VPC peering connections can allow network traffic between
        untrusted or unapproved subscriptions, leading to potential data
        exposure or exfiltration.

      title: Lack of Network Visibility due to Disabled VPC Flow Logs
      description: |
        VPC subnets with disabled flow logs lack critical network traffic
        visibility, which can lead to undetected unauthorized access,
        data exfiltration, and network misconfigurations. This lack of
        visibility increases the risk of undetected security incidents.

      title: Overly Permissive VPC Endpoint Policies

        VPC Endpoint policies that are overly permissive may inadvertently expose
        resources within the VPC to unintended principals or external threats.

        summary: |
            This initial release is part of the first batch of control catalogs
            produced by the CCC. It is the result of thousands of hours dedicated to
            exploring different ways of working and collaborating, on top of time
            spent researching, writing, and reviewing the content. This marks a huge
            milestone for the CCC and the broader community as further releases will
            continue to build on this foundation. A huge thanks to everyone who has
            brought us to this point!
