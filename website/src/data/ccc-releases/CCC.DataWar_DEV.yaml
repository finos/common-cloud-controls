              When a port is exposed for non-SSH network traffic, all traffic

              Most cloud services enable TLS 1.3 by default. Where it is not
              already set, ensure that your services are configured or updated
              accordingly.

              Any time port 22 is exposed, ensure that it has a properly

              Review firewall, load balancer, and application configurations to
              ensure insecure protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and Telnet are not
              exposed. Where possible, implement automatic redirection to secure
              protocols such as HTTPS, SFTP, SSH, and regularly scan for
              protocol drift.

              When a port is exposed, the service MUST ensure that the protocol

              other, is run on that port.

              Reference the IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number
              Registry for more information about correct protocol-to-port
              assignments. Avoid running non-standard services on well-known

              When a service transmits data using TLS, mutual TLS (mTLS) MUST be

              Configure mTLS for all endpoints that process or transmit
              sensitive data. Ensure both client and server certificates are
              validated and managed securely. Regularly review certificate
              authorities and automate certificate rotation where possible.
