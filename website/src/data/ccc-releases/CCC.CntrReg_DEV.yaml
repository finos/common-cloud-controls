      The Data control family ensures the confidentiality, integrity,
      availability, and sovereignty of data across its lifecycle.
      These controls govern how data is transmitted, stored,
      replicated, and protected from unauthorized access, tampering,
      or exposure beyond defined trust perimeters.

              When a port is exposed for non-SSH network traffic, all traffic

              Most cloud services enable TLS 1.3 by default. Where it is not

              Any time port 22 is exposed, ensure that it has a properly

              Review firewall, load balancer, and application configurations to
              ensure insecure protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and Telnet are not
              exposed. Where possible, implement automatic redirection to secure
              protocols such as HTTPS, SFTP, SSH, and regularly scan for
              protocol drift.

              other, is run on that port.

              Registry for more information about correct protocol-to-port
              assignments. Avoid running non-standard services on well-known

              Configure mTLS for all endpoints that process or transmit
              sensitive data. Ensure both client and server certificates are
              validated and managed securely. Regularly review certificate
              authorities and automate certificate rotation where possible.

    title: Identity and Access Management
    description: |
      The Identity and Access Management control family ensures
      that only trusted and authenticated entities can access
      resources. These controls establish strong authentication,
      enforce multi-factor verification, and restrict access to
      approved sources to prevent unauthorized use or data exfiltration.

          Ensure that secure access controls enforce the principle of least
          privilege to restrict access to authorized entities from explicitly
          trusted sources only.

    title: Resource Constraints are Exhausted
    description: |
      Exceeding the resource constraints through excessive consumption,
      resource-intensive operations, or lowering of rate-limit thresholds
      can impact the availability of elements such as memory, CPU, or storage.
      This may disrupt availability of the service or child resources by
      denying the associated functionality to users. If the impacted system is
      not designed to expect such a failure, the effect could also cascade to
      other services and resources.

    title: Older Resource Versions are Used
    description: |
      Running older versions of child resources can expose the system to known
      vulnerabilities that have been addressed in more recent versions. If the
      version identifier is detected by an attacker, it may be possible to
      exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the confidentiality,
      integrity, or availability of the system and its data.

    description: |
      Automated processes may be used to gather details about service and
      child resource elements such as APIs, file systems, or directories.
      This information can reveal vulnerabilities, misconfigurations,
      and the network topology, which can be used to plan an attack against
      the system, the service, or its child resources.

      This can impact system availability by delaying the detection of
      incidents while also impacting system design decisions and enforcement of
      operational thresholds, such as autoscaling or cost management.
