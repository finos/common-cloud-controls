      An attacker can evade detection by intentionally crafting input that violates
      the size constraints of a clouds audit logging mechanism.
      Many systems impose a maximum size limit on individual log entries.
      By performing an action with oversized data such as whitespace or Unicode injection,
      the resulting log event, which often includes the offending data,
      exceeds this limit, which often is redacted in the audit logs.

      with political or physical control over the network in which they are
      deployed. Confidentiality may be impacted if the data is replicated to a
      network where the geopolitical status is untrusted, unstable, or insecure.

    description: |
      Services that rely on accurate data are susceptible to disruption in the
      event of data loss or corruption. Any actions that lead to the unintended
      deletion, alteration, or limited access to data can impact the
      availability of the service and the system it is part of.

    description: |
      Tampering or deletion of service logs will reduce the system's ability to
      maintain an accurate record of events. Any actions that compromise the
      integrity of logs could disrupt system availability by disrupting
      monitoring, hindering forensic investigations, and reducing the accuracy
      of audit trails.

    description: |
      Unauthorized access to logs may expose valuable information about the
      system's configuration, operations, and security mechanisms. This could
      jeopardize system availability through the exposure of vulnerabilities
      and support the planning of attacks on the service, system, or network.
      If logs are not adequately sanitized, this may also directly impact the
      confidentiality of sensitive data.

    title: Publications are Disabled
    description: |
      Publication of events, metrics, and runtime logs may be disabled, leading
      to a lack of expected security and operational information being shared.
      This can impact system availability by delaying the detection of
      incidents while also impacting system design decisions and enforcement of
      operational thresholds, such as autoscaling or cost management.
