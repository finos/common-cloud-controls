              When a static credential such as an access key has existed for 90 days or more,
              it must be automatically rotated to reduce the risk of compromise due to long-term
              exposure. Organizations should implement automated checks to identify aging credentials
              and enforce rotation policies. Additionally, access key usage should be regularly monitored,
              and credentials that are no longer in use should be deactivated or deleted promptly.
              Where possible, prefer temporary, short-lived credentials over long-lived static ones
              to further minimize risk.

    title: Valid Cloud Credentials Abuse
    description: |
      Valid identity credentials such as access keys, tokens or passwords are misused or
      compromised. Examples include public exposure, token theft, unprotected
      metadata service of a compromised compute instance or brute-force attacks.
      The use of these credentials can provide unauthorized access to the cloud environment,
      potentially bypassing other security controls and enabling lateral movement across
      cloud resources.

      to directly assume the target role, the principal can attach it to a new resource
      they control and then use that resource to perform unauthorized actions.
