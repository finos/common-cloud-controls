    Build refers to a fully managed continuous integration service offered by
    cloud service providers for build automation. It is designed to compile
    source code, run tests, and produce deployable artifacts without having to
    setup, manage or scale your own infrastructure for running build servers.

              When a port is exposed for non-SSH network traffic, all traffic

              Most cloud services enable TLS 1.3 by default. Where it is not

              sensitive data. Ensure both client and server certificates are
              validated and managed securely. Regularly review certificate
              authorities and automate certificate rotation where possible.

              No normal business operations should disable

              access. Ensure that logging mechanisms are tightly integrated with

    title: Automated Enumeration and Reconnaissance by Non-human Entities
    description: |
      Automated processes may be used to gather details about service and
      child resource elements such as APIs, file systems, or directories.
      This information can reveal vulnerabilities, misconfigurations,
      and the network topology, which can be used to plan an attack against
      the system, the service, or its child resources.

    title: Publications are Disabled
    description: |
      Publication of events, metrics, and runtime logs may be disabled, leading
      to a lack of expected security and operational information being shared.
      This can impact system availability by delaying the detection of
      incidents while also impacting system design decisions and enforcement of
      operational thresholds, such as autoscaling or cost management.
