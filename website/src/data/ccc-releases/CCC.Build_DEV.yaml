      The Data control family ensures the confidentiality, integrity,
      availability, and sovereignty of data across its lifecycle.
      These controls govern how data is transmitted, stored,
      replicated, and protected from unauthorized access, tampering,
      or exposure beyond defined trust perimeters.

              When a port is exposed for non-SSH network traffic, all traffic
              MUST include a TLS handshake AND be encrypted using TLS 1.3 or

              Most cloud services enable TLS 1.3 by default. Where it is not
              already set, ensure that your services are configured or updated
              accordingly.

            recommendation: |
              Any time port 22 is exposed, ensure that it has a properly
              implemented SSH server with SSHv2 enabled and configured with
              strong ciphers.

              Review firewall, load balancer, and application configurations to
              ensure insecure protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and Telnet are not
              exposed. Where possible, implement automatic redirection to secure
              protocols such as HTTPS, SFTP, SSH, and regularly scan for
              protocol drift.

              When a port is exposed, the service MUST ensure that the protocol

              other, is run on that port.

            recommendation: |
              Reference the IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number
              Registry for more information about correct protocol-to-port
              assignments. Avoid running non-standard services on well-known
              ports.

              When a service transmits data using TLS, mutual TLS (mTLS) MUST be

            recommendation: |
              Configure mTLS for all endpoints that process or transmit
              sensitive data. Ensure both client and server certificates are
              validated and managed securely. Regularly review certificate
              authorities and automate certificate rotation where possible.

              No normal business operations should disable

    title: Identity and Access Management
    description: |
      The Identity and Access Management control family ensures
      that only trusted and authenticated entities can access
      resources. These controls establish strong authentication,
      enforce multi-factor verification, and restrict access to
      approved sources to prevent unauthorized use or data exfiltration.
    controls:

        title: Prevent Access from Untrusted Entities
        objective: |
          Ensure that secure access controls enforce the principle of least
          privilege to restrict access to authorized entities from explicitly
          trusted sources only.

    title: Older Resource Versions are Used
    description: |
      Running older versions of child resources can expose the system to known
      vulnerabilities that have been addressed in more recent versions. If the
      version identifier is detected by an attacker, it may be possible to
      exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the confidentiality,
      integrity, or availability of the system and its data.

    title: Automated Enumeration and Reconnaissance by Non-human Entities
    description: |
      Automated processes may be used to gather details about service and
      child resource elements such as APIs, file systems, or directories.
      This information can reveal vulnerabilities, misconfigurations,
      and the network topology, which can be used to plan an attack against
      the system, the service, or its child resources.

    title: Publications are Disabled
    description: |
      Publication of events, metrics, and runtime logs may be disabled, leading
      to a lack of expected security and operational information being shared.
      This can impact system availability by delaying the detection of
      incidents while also impacting system design decisions and enforcement of
      operational thresholds, such as autoscaling or cost management.
