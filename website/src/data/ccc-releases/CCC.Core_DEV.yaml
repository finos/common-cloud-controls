  description: |
    The Common Cloud Controls Core catalog serves as a foundational repository
    of reusable security controls, capabilities, and threat models that can be
    referenced and imported by other service-specific catalogs. This provides
    a centralized mechanism for maintaining consistency and reducing
    duplication across the broader controls ecosystem.

      description: |
        The Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) is a cybersecurity framework developed
        by the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) to provide a structured and
        standardized set of security controls for cloud computing environments.
        The primary purpose of CCM is to help organizations assess the overall
        security posture of their cloud infrastructure and services.

              When a port is exposed for non-SSH network traffic, all traffic

              Most cloud services enable TLS 1.3 by default. Where it is not

    title: Responses are Generated for Unauthorized Requests
    description: |
      The service may generate responses to requests from unauthorized entities.
      This could lead to the exposure of system details, which may be used to
      plan an attack against the service, system, or network. Additionally,
      allocating resources to service the request could lead to a denial of
      service for legitimate users, leading to a loss of availability anywhere
      in the system.
