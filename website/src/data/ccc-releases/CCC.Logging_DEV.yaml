    Logging is the process of collecting, storing and analyzing event data
    generated by your cloud infrastructure. Logs can cover detailed timestamped
    records of activities in your infrastructure or application layer.

        objective: |
          Ensure all operational and security logs from across the cloud environment, including
          applications, operating systems, network traffic, and cloud service activity, are captured
          automatically and streamed to a central, secure log management service.

              No normal business operations should result in the redirection of
              logs, as this could indicate an attempt to cover up unauthorized
              access. Ensure that logging configurations are immutable during
              service operation so that any changes require stopping the service
              and publishing corresponding events to monitored channels.

      Data transmitted by the service is susceptible to collection by any entity
      with access to any part of the transmission path. Packet observations can

      interception or modification in transit if not properly encrypted,
      impacting the confidentiality or integrity of the transmitted data.
