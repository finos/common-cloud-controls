      A GenAI model may generate content that is incorrect, misleading or
      harmful, such as convincing misinformation (hallucinations) or vulnerable
      or malicious code, due to its reliance on statistical patterns rather
      than factual understanding. Directly using this flawed output without
      validation can lead to system compromises, poor decision-making, and
      legal or reputational damage.

    description: |
      A model-based agent, given the authority to execute tools or interact
      with APIs, may perform an action that is harmful, incorrect, or not
      aligned with the user's true intent in response to a prompt. This can
      be caused by the model misinterpreting an ambiguous prompt or being
      manipulated by an adversary into misusing its delegated authority.

      jeopardize system availability through the exposure of vulnerabilities

      If logs are not adequately sanitized, this may also directly impact the

    description: |
      Exceeding the resource constraints through excessive consumption,
      resource-intensive operations, or lowering of rate-limit thresholds
      can impact the availability of elements such as memory, CPU, or storage.
      This may disrupt availability of the service or child resources by
      denying the associated functionality to users. If the impacted system is
      not designed to expect such a failure, the effect could also cascade to
      other services and resources.
