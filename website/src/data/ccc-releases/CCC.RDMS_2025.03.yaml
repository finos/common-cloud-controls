            summary: |
                This initial release is part of the first batch of control catalogs
                produced by the CCC. It is the result of thousands of hours dedicated to
                exploring different ways of working and collaborating, on top of time
                spent researching, writing, and reviewing the content. This marks a huge
                milestone for the CCC and the broader community as further releases will
                continue to build on this foundation. A huge thanks to everyone who has
                brought us to this point!

      objective: |
        Ensure that all sensitive activities require two or more identity factors
        during authentication to prevent unauthorized access. This may include
        something you know, something you have, or something you are. In the
        case of programattically accessible services, such as API endpoints, this
        includes a combination of API keys or tokens and network restrictions.

      objective: |
        Ensure that secure access controls prevent unauthorized access,
        mitigate risks of data exfiltration, and block misuse of services
        by adversaries. This includes restricting access based on trust
        criteria such as IP allowlists, domain restrictions, and tenant
        isolation.

      title: Data is Replicated to Untrusted or External Locations
      description: |
        Data may be replicated to untrusted or external locations if replication
        configurations are not properly restricted. This could result
        in unintended data leakage or exposure outside the organization's trusted
        perimeter.

      title: Resource Constraints are Exhausted
      description: |
        Resource constraints, such as memory, CPU, or storage, may be exhausted
        due to misconfigurations, or excessive resource consumption. This could
        disrupt service availability, deny access to users, or impact other
        systems within the same scope. Exhaustion may occur through repeated
        requests, resource-intensive operations, or lowering rate/budget limits.

      title: Older Resource Versions are Exploited
      description: |
        Older versions of resources may contain vulnerabilities due to deprecated
        or insecure configurations. Without proper version control and monitoring,
        outdated versions could lead to security measures bypass, potentially
        leading to security risks or operational disruptions.

      title: Automated Enumeration and Reconnaissance by Non-human Entities
      description: |
        Automated processes or bots may be used to perform reconnaissance by
        enumerating resources such as APIs, file systems, or directories. These
        activities can reveal potential vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or
        unsecured resources, which might result in unauthorized access or data
        exposure.

        summary: |
            This initial release is part of the first batch of control catalogs
            produced by the CCC. It is the result of thousands of hours dedicated to
            exploring different ways of working and collaborating, on top of time
            spent researching, writing, and reviewing the content. This marks a huge
            milestone for the CCC and the broader community as further releases will
            continue to build on this foundation. A huge thanks to everyone who has
            brought us to this point!
