        title: Define Access Mode for ML Development Environments
        objective: |
          Ensure that access to Machine Learning Development Environment (MLDE)
          resources is strictly defined and controlled.
          Only authorized users with appropriate permissions can access these environments,
          mitigating the risk of unauthorized access, data leakage, or service disruption.
