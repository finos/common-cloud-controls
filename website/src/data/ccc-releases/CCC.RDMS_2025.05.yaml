        title: Password Management
        objective: |
          Ensure default vendor-supplied DB administrator credentials are replaced
          with strong, unique passwords and that these credentials are properly
          managed using a secure password or secrets management solution.

              When an attempt is made to authenticate to the database using known
              default credentials, the authentication attempt must fail and no
              access should be granted.

        objective: |
          Ensure the database enforces lockouts or rate-limiting after a specified
          number of failed authentication attempts. This prevents brute force
          or password-guessing attacks from succeeding.

              When repeated failed login attempts are made in a short timeframe,
              the account must be locked out or rate-limited to prevent
              further login attempts.

          Restrict who can initiate, manage, and validate database backup or
          restore operations through strict role-based or least-privilege
          access. Prevents accidental or malicious restorations, protecting

          accounts, thereby minimizing the risk of data exposure or exfiltration.
