        summary: |
            This initial release is part of the first batch of control catalogs
            produced by the CCC. It is the result of thousands of hours dedicated to
            exploring different ways of working and collaborating, on top of time
            spent researching, writing, and reviewing the content. This marks a huge
            milestone for the CCC and the broader community as further releases will
            continue to build on this foundation. A huge thanks to everyone who has
            brought us to this point!

          objective: |
            Ensure default vendor-supplied DB administrator credentials are replaced
            with strong, unique passwords and that these credentials are properly
            managed using a secure password or secrets management solution.

                When an attempt is made to authenticate to the database using known
                default credentials, the authentication attempt must fail and no
                access should be granted.

          title: Account Lockout and Rate-Limiting
          objective: |
            Ensure the database enforces lockouts or rate-limiting after a specified
            number of failed authentication attempts. This prevents brute force
            or password-guessing attacks from succeeding.

          title: Access Control for Backup and Restore Operations
          objective: |
            Restrict who can initiate, manage, and validate database backup or
            restore operations through strict role-based or least-privilege
            access. Prevents accidental or malicious restorations, protecting
            data integrity and availability.

                When there is an attempt to perform a backup or restore,

                credentials or roles that are not explicitly authorized for
                backup/restore functions.

          title: Restrict Snapshot Sharing to Authorized Accounts
          objective: |
            Ensure database snapshots can only be shared with explicitly authorized
            accounts, thereby minimizing the risk of data exposure or exfiltration.
          requirements:
            - id: CCC.RDMS.C05.TR01
              text: |
                When an attempt is made to share a snapshot with an unauthorized

          objective: |
            Ensure database backups are automatically scheduled, actively monitored,
            and promptly reported if any disruptions occur. This helps maintain
            data integrity, facilitates disaster recovery, and supports business
            continuity when a system failure or breach occurs.
