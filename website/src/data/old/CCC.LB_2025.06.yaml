        summary: |
            This initial release is part of the first batch of control catalogs
            produced by the CCC. It is the result of thousands of hours dedicated to
            exploring different ways of working and collaborating, on top of time
            spent researching, writing, and reviewing the content. This marks a huge
            milestone for the CCC and the broader community as further releases will
            continue to build on this foundation. A huge thanks to everyone who has
            brought us to this point!

                When a single client sends more than 2000 requests within any
                5-minute sliding window, the load balancer MUST throttle all
                subsequent requests from that client for at least 60 seconds.
