# Duplication Reduction Working Group

This [WG] facilitates the research of existing frameworks for the Common Cloud Controls project community.

## Mission

This working group will evaluate the tools, assets, and partners that exist in the cloud controls space that can help reduce the effort required to meet the overall CCC goals for the CCC contributors and consumers. 

Our goal is to ensure the CCC efforts do not duplicate pre-existing standards, and instead are net new contributions to the broader ecosystem aligned to the specific needs of the financial services industry.

## Approach

This work will span 2 main outputs:

### 1 — Investigate existing frameworks

The first step is to identify a set of existing frameworks and capabilities that we should investigate (eg. NIST, ISO, OSCAL, MITRE, etc) against the CCC goals. 

Process:
1. Develop a set of principles and goals to consider for evaluating frameworks 
2. Research a set of frameworks to consider
3. Evaluate each frameworks ability to meet the overall CCC goals
4. Idenitfy how each framework can help achieve each goal, likely provided as a starting point or framework for other work groups.

### 2 — Articulate recommendations to other working groups

After investigating and aligning frameworks to build upon, we will produce a written overview of each framework recommended and the reasoning behind that selection. This should include already completed decisions such as MITRE ATT&CK, OSCAL, and others which form a basis for other work group products. Overviews should be concise but allow for future contributors to understand and re-evaluate any recommendations made if appropriate as standards and technology evolves.

In addition, we should provide a clear set of what's missing from these exixsting frameworks, and identify how the work being done in CCC augments/improves these systems.

## Responsibilities

- Propose and maintain recommended frameworks and documented research and reasoning
- Provide advice and support to WGs


### Output / Deliverables

This group should, at minimum, create and maintain the following items in the project GitHub repository.
* One frameworks overview page with investigations performed and insights
* One page per selected framework on reasoning and how it will be used

## Out of Scope

This [WG] is not responsible for approving proposed frameworks or ensuring compliance with recommendations.

To reduce unilateral authority from either this group or the [SC], all framework recommendations should come from this group and be finalized through a vote from the [SC].

## Membership

The membership structure of this [WG], including roles and responsibilities, must adhere to the latest recommendations from the Community Structure [WG]. 

Where recommendations do note yet exist on a topic, this [WG] should follow guidance from the CCC [SC].

## Community Cadence

A member of this [WG] should be present on for any calls scheduled by the [SC] for participation by the full CCC community, such as quarterly [SC] calls.

This [WG] will use the mail group <ccc-duplication-reduction@lists.finos.org> for regular communications.

## Changes

Changes to this charter must be approved through a majority vote by the [SC].
