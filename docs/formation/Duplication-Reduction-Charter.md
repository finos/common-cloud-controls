# Duplication Reduction Charter

In April 2024, the CCC community identified a need for an update to the working groups to best reflect the work to be accomplished. 

This space was chartered with a goal to evaluate the tools, assets, and partners that exist in the cloud controls space that can help reduce the effort required to meet the overall CCC goals. 

This work will span 2 phases:

# Phase 1 — Investigate existing frameworks

The first step is to identify a set of existing frameworks and capabilities that we should investigate (eg. NIST, ISO, OSCAL, MITRE, etc) against the CCC goals. 

Process:
1. Develop a set of principles and goals to consider for evaluating frameworks 
2. Research a set of frameworks to consider
3. Evaluate each frameworks ability to meet the overall CCC goals
4. Idenitfy how each framework can help achieve each goal, likely provided as a starting point or framework for other work groups.

# Phase 2 — Articulate why we've choosen each framework

After investigating and choosing frameworks to build upon, we will produce a written overview of each framework choosen and the reasoning behind that decision. This should include already completed decisions such as MITRE ATT&CK, OSCAL, and others which form a basis for other work group products. Overviews should be concise but allow for future contributors to understand and re-evaluate any decisions made if appropriate as standards and technology evolves.

In addition, we should provide a clear set of what's missing from these exixsting frameworks, and identify how the work being done in CCC augments/improves these systems.
