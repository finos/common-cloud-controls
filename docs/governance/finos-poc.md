# FINOS Point-of-Contact (POC)

Most administative tasks around FINOS projects are performed by [FINOS Help](help@finos.org), such as changing mailing lists, meeting cadence, tool support etc.

CCC is currently a FINOS strategic initiative and as such as an appointed POC. This role is responsible for:

1.  Representing the project to the FINOS community.
2.  Helping with CCC marketing, recruitment and promotion.
3.  General advice around open source governance and community management.
4.  Project administration tasks where necessary.
5.  Engaging with other parts of the FINOS / LF organisation, including board-level reporting.

The FINOS POC is responsible to the FINOS Board-appointed CCC Executive sponsors, who can set direction for the FINOS involvement in CCC as a strategic initiative, apart from the general CCC community goals. The FINOS POC is therefore also responsible for:

1.  Representing the interests of the CCC Executive sponsors to the project.
2.  Attempting to action executive sponsors requests where possible.
