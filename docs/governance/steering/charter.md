# Common Cloud Controls Steering Committee Charter

This document outlines the mission, scope, and objectives of the Common Cloud Controls (CCC) Steering Committee.

## Mission

The CCC Steering Committee is the governing body of the CCC project, providing decision-making and oversight pertaining to the CCC project bylaws, sub-organizations, and financial planning.  The Steering Committee also defines the project values and structure.

## Approach

* Adapt the role and structure of the Steering Committee to meet the ongoing needs of the project.
* Responsibilities not explicitly delegated to other parties<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup> through their respective charters reside with the Steering Committee.
* All management<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> responsibilities should be delegated to other parties<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>.
* All technical responsibilities should be delegated to working groups. The Steering Committee should not retain any technical responsibilities itself.
* The steering committee will hold a public community call no less than once per quarter to provide updates to stakeholders regarding all CCC efforts.

## Direct responsibilities of the Steering Committee

The following responsibilities belong directly to the Steering Committee.

* Define, evolve, and defend the non-technical vision / mission and the values of the project.
* Delegate ownership of, responsibility for, and authority over areas of the project to specific entities<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>.
* Charter and refine policy for defining new community groups<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup>, and establish transparency and accountability policies for such groups.
* Appoint leadership for chartered community groups.
* Enforce charters for community groups<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup> to ensure ongoing positive standing, or decomission any groups not in good standing.
* Define and evolve project and group<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup> governance structures and policies<sup>[4](#footnote4)</sup>.
* Act as a final non-technical escalation point for any CCC community group or technical effort.
* Decide who is a standing member on the CCC project, and what privileges that entails.
* Control and delegate access to and establish processes regarding project resources<sup>[5](#footnote5)</sup>.
* Coordinate with FINOS regarding usage of the CCC brand and deciding which things can be called "Common Cloud Controls," as well as how that mark can be used in relation to other efforts or vendors.
* Request funds and other support from FINOS (e.g. marketing, press, etc).
* Interface with the FINOS Staff point of contact as needed for guidance and accountability.

## Non-responsibilities of the Steering Committee

* Technical decision-making.
* Chartering, approval, or oversight of any sub-groups created by Steering-chartered community groups (those which are authorized to do so within their charter).
* Files and resources outside of:
  - the CCC project README.md
  - Steering Committee governance documentation

## FINOS Point of Contact

In addition to general foundation support given to projects, the Steering Committee will have an assigned point of contact. This should be tracked in the same documentation as the list of current Steering Commmittee members.

## Membership

### Composition

The Steering Committee is composed of seven (7) members and shall always be considered this size regardless of temporary vacancies, for the purpose of voting majority and supermajority considerations.

**Reserved Seats —** Four (4) seats on the committee are reserved for FINOS members from financial services institutions. These seats may not be occupied by more than one individual from the same institution<sup>[6](#footnote6)</sup>. In the event that a committee member occupying an FSI seat undergoes a change of employment, they may retain their seat while in noncompliance for 30 calendar days before it is automatically considered vacant.

**Community Seats —** Three (3) seats on the committee are not reserved, and may be filled by any community member from any organization.

### Elections

Every year, the Steering Committee holds a general election for open seats.

Our [election policy] document covers the details for how this works.

### Vacancies

In the event of a resignation or other loss of an elected committee member, the next most preferred candidate from the previous election will be offered the seat. A maximum of one (1) committee member may be selected this way between elections.

In case this fails to fill the seat, a special election for that position will be held as soon as possible.

[Eligible voters] from the most recent election will vote in the special election (eligibility will not be redetermined at the time of the special election).

A committee member elected in a special election will serve out the remainder of the term for the person they are replacing, regardless of the length of that remainder.

### Removal

A committee member may remove themselves or be removed through the following processes.

#### Resignation

If a committee member chooses not to continue in their role, for whatever self-elected reason, they must notify the full committee in writing.

#### No confidence

A Steering Committee member may be removed by an affirmative vote of a **_three-quarters supermajority of the [fixed membership of the committee](#composition)_**.

The call for a vote of no confidence will happen in a public Steering Committee meeting and must be documented as a GitHub issue in the repository.

The call for a vote of no confidence must be made by a current member of the committee and must be seconded by another current member. The committee member who calls for the vote must include on the issue a statement which provides context on the reason for the vote.

Once a vote of no confidence has been called, the committee will notify the community through the CCC mailing list.

This notification will include:

* a link to the aforementioned GitHub issue
* the statement providing context on the reason for the vote

There will be a period of two (2) weeks for members of the community to reach out to Steering Committee members to provide feedback.

Community members may provide feedback by the following methods:

* comment on the GitHub issue
* send an email to the Steering Committee private mailing list
  - the mailing list will be launched and linked here after the first phase of bootstraping is complete
* send a message to individual committee members

After this feedback period, Steering Committee members must vote on the issue within 48 hours.

If the vote of no confidence is passed, the member in question will be immediately removed from the committee.

## Voting

In the course of the committee's operations, members will be expected to vote on all decisions made within the body's purview.

These votes may be called on agreed-upon platforms by the committee, such as:

* a pull request
* an issue
* a Steering Committee [meeting](#meetings)
* a mailing list

For public business, the vote must be captured on an issue or pull request.

### Routine business

Unless otherwise specified by a process, the requirement for passing a vote is a **_majority of the [fixed membership of the committee](#composition)_**.

### Abstention

For any self-elected reason, members of the committee may decide to abstain from a vote.

Abstaining members will only be considered as contributing to quorum, in the event that a vote is called in a meeting.

## Meetings

Steering Committee members are generally expected to attend every meeting.

### Quorum

We use the following guidelines to determine whether we have reached quorum and are able to proceed with a meeting:

- Quorum **to meet** is a **_majority of the [fixed membership of the committee](#composition)_**.
- Quorum **to vote in a meeting** is a **_two-thirds supermajority of the [fixed membership of the committee](#composition)_**.

## Inclusive Leadership Training

Members of the committee must take the [Inclusive Open Source Community Orientation] course
in support of our community values.  Members are required to report completion of the course as part of on-boarding within 30 days from the date of their appointment.

## Changes

Committee members may propose a change to this document through the following process:

- Post a pull request to this repository describing the change.
- Call a public vote for the nearest acceptable business day four (4) weeks after initial 
  introduction of the change. A vote may be scheduled earlier if all committee members consent.
- The change is accepted if three-quarters of the committee members vote in favor.
- The pull request is merged or closed.
