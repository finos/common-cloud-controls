# Common Cloud Controls (CCC) Steering Committee Elections

This document outlines the process for steering committee [elections].

## Eligibility

Restrictions on candidacy and voting are in place to ensure that the CCC project is led by individuals who are highly trusted, impactful, and currently active in the community.

### Eligibility for voting

In order to be eligible for voting, an individual must:

- Be an FINOS Member<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> who had a substantial contribution to the CCC project within 12 months prior to their nomination. Contributions include GitHub events like creating issues, creating PRs, reviewing PRs, commenting on issues, etc.
- Be an appointed or elected member of one or more active [community groups] within 4 months prior to their nomination.
- Demonstrate expertise in any subfield of cybersecurity, or general working experience in cybersecurity for financial services, within 2 years prior to their nomination.

_It is the responsibility of the steering committee to refine these criteria prior to each election, including setting the number of required contributions, and adding any additional committee memberships that include eligibility._

### Eligibility for candidacy

In order to be eligible for candidacy, an individual must:

- Be eligible for voting in the current Steering Committee election.
- Accept a nomination or self-nominate.
- Be endorsed by another party from their own employer.
- Be endorsed by at least one eligible voter from a financial institution who is
  not the candidate's employer.

In the event that multiple candidates from the same employer are nominated for a reserved seat, only the candidate with the most votes will be selected.

Refer to the [elections procedure] for more information about how to nominate and endorse candidates in any CCC election.

### Eligibility for Nomination and Endorsement

Any FINOS member may nominate as many people as they wish to. We recommend that you validate the eligibility of your candidate prior to nomination.

[Eligible voters](#eligibility-for-voting) may endorse nominees or campaign as they see fit.

## Terms and Election Cycles

Steering committee members are elected to serve a two (2) year term. Members can serve two (2) consecutive terms and a lifetime of four (4) terms. Terms that result in less than or equal to one (1) year served are exempt.

Election cycles are scheduled such that roughly half of the seats come up for re-election each year for purposes of continuity. The exact number of seats alternates between three (3) and four (4).

### Bootstrap Election

In the [bootstrap] process (which does not follow the guidelines set forth here) four (4) seats will be allocated for 364-day terms, to stagger all future [elections]. The committee will be responsible for self-allocation of these seats.

### Emeritus Term

Members of the steering committee who complete a term will graduate to becoming Emeritus members of the steering committee upon vacating their seat. This confers honor on the recipient, acknowledging the significant contributions they have made to the project. Emeritus members have no binding vote, and no expectation of continued participation in steering committee affairs.

## Election Schedule and Operation

After the [bootstrap] election, the steering committee is responsible for the appointment of election officers to operate the election and circulate an exact election timeline to the community. The steering committee should provide the election officer with a desired timeline based on current community needs.

For example:

- End of July
  - Election officers
  - Voter eligibility criteria
  - Election preparation
- September
  - Nomination period and election
- October
  - Conclusion of Election
  - Results announced at first community meeting after the election concludes

The election officers will choose exact dates for each step and propose the final schedule to the Steering Committee.

### Nomination and Election Procedure

Nominations will be made using the _Nomination_ GitHub Issue template.

[Elections] will be held using an online preference election system which supports [Condorcet] elections. The most preferred candidates will be elected to the open seats.

### Election Officer Eligibility

The steering committee should choose multiple election officers using the following criteria, so as to promote healthy rotation and diversity:

- Each individual must be eligible to vote.
- Each individual must have been a FINOS member for at least one year.
- At least one election officer should have served before.
- Each officer should come from a different employer.
- Each officer can be relied upon to follow the [election procedure].

History of election officers:

| Year | Officers |
| ---- | -------- |
| 2024 | TBD      |

## Steering Committee and Election Officer Recusal

Currently serving steering committee members and the appointed election officers
pledge to recuse themselves from any form of electioneering, including
campaigning, nominating, or endorsing. Violations of this pledge should lead to
a vote of no confidence in the offending party.

Steering committee members _may_ ask other contributors to consider running,
and they _may_ vote, so long as this information is kept private.

Steering committee members who intend to run for re-election _may_
self-nominate but are otherwise expected to adhere to this recusal.
