# Common Cloud Controls Community Structure

The CCC community is organized into a structure that enables contributors from diverse backgrounds to collaborate on developing the Common Cloud Controls (CCC) standards. This structure ensures efficient governance, clear guidance for contributors, and effective management of the project's technical and non-technical aspects.

All community group participants must strictly adhere to the the [FINOS Code of Conduct].

## Steering Committee

The **Steering Committee (SC)** is the ultimate governance body of the CCC project, responsible for strategic oversight, financial planning, defining the project's values, high-level decision-making, and coordination with the FINOS TOC or Board. It also handles the overall project structure and delegation of responsibilities.

While the [SC] is made of experts in the field of cybersecurity, it is intended to be a facilitator and overseer of excellent decision-making, rather than a technical decision-maker itself.

Steering Committee membership is presented in the [README.md] of the main CCC repo.

Review the [Steering Committee Charter] for more information.

## Community Governance

The CCC community adheres to a transparent and open governance model. Decisions are made through consensus or vote, depending on the relevant group charter.

Non-technical issues or high-level design decisions may be escalated to the [SC] if a decision or conflict is not resolved in a timely manner (relative to the time-sensitivity of the issue).

Technical issues should be resolved by the relevant community group. Failure to resolve technical issues may be escalated to the [SC] for guidance on finding a resolution.

## Changes to the Community Structure

Changes to the community structure can be proposed through pull requests. All changes must be approved in accordance with the relevant group charter.
