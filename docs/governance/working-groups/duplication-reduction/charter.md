## Mission

This [WG] facilitates the research of existing frameworks for the Common Cloud Controls project community through evaluation of tools, assets, and partners that exist in the cloud controls space that can help reduce the effort required to meet the overall CCC goals for the CCC contributors and consumers.

Efforts from this group will ensure that the CCC efforts do not duplicate pre-existing standards, and instead are net new contributions to the broader ecosystem aligned to the specific needs of the financial services industry.

## Approach

This group will:

- Identify existing resources that we should investigate for use toward various CCC [WG] goals, including tools, approaches, or frameworks.
- Develop a set of principles and goals to consider for evaluating resources
- Evaluate each resource's ability to meet project goals
- Idenitfy how each resource can help achieve a goal, in a way that can serve as a starting point or reference for other [WG]s
- Document research that has been done on each resource 
- Provide a clear set of what's missing from existing frameworks such as NIST, ISO, OSCAL, and MITRE, with how the work being done in CCC augments or improves these systems
- Collaborate with the [Community Structure WG] to create new [recommendations] or policies regarding the use of specific resources, with links to documented research and reasoning
- Provide advice and support related to duplicative efforts to all [WG]s

### Output / Deliverables
