# Policies & Recommendations

There are two types of guidliness that will be issued to govern the CCC [WG]s.

## Policies

Policies are guidelines which have been proposed by the community structure [WG] and which have been approved by [SC].

All [WG]s must adhere to the policies.

## Recommendations

Recommendations are guidelines which have been suggested by the community structure [WG]. While these guidelines have not been approved by the [SC] and made into a policy it is strongly suggested that each [WG] follow the recommendations.

## Upgrading a Recommendation to become a Policy

In order for a recommendation to become a policy a [SC] sponsor must be found. The proposer can raise a PR with the necessary changes i.e. moving the reccomendation to the policies directory. The [SC] sponsor can call a [SC] vote and if approved by the majority the PR can be merged and the recommendation is now a policy.

## Changes

Changes to this policy/recommendation must be approved through a majority vote by the [SC].
