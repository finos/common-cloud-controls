# Proposing a Working Group

To propose a new working group complete the items in the list below:

* Create a PR which is attached to a GitHub issue with details of why the [WG] is needed.

    * The PR should have a draft charter which follows this [template](../templates/charter.md).

* Propose a [WG] Lead.

* Find a [SC] to sponsor the [WG].

    * The [SC] sponsor can call for a vote on the new [WG]. If the proposal recieves a majority vote then it can be considered active.

* Once the [SC] has approved the [WG] create a mailing list for the [WG] by emailing <help@finos.org>. The mailing list should use the naming convention ```ccc-[wg-name]@lists.finos.org```.

## Changes

Changes to this policy/recommendation must be approved through a majority vote by the [SC].
