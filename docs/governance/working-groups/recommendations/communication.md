# Communication

## Mailing Lists

A mailing list should be used as the main means of distributing written communications for all activities related to the CCC Project.

To create a new mailing list email help@finos.org. Mailing Lists should only be created for a new [WG] or at the discretion of the [SC].

## Meetings

### FINOS Reporting Meetings

Weekly reporting meetings hosted by FINOS should be attended by all [WG] leads or an appropriate delegate.

These meetings will be used to report high level updates to the project and for FINOS representatives or [SC] to pass on appropriate updates.

These meetings are advertised on the FINOS Calendar.

### Regular [WG] Meetings

Some [WG]s may chose to hold regular meetings to provide a space for discussion of [WG] specific activities. If a [WG] decides this is necessary then the details of the meeting should be published to members of the [WG] using the corresponding mailing list.

Any regular [WG] wide meetings should have minutes taken and made available.

### Ad hoc [WG] Meetings

Ad hoc meetings between [WG] members can be scheudled between group members as and when required. Minutes of these meetings are not required but any notworthy decisions or outcomes should be communicated back to the wider [WG] via the mailing list.

## Changes

Changes to this policy/recommendation must be approved through a majority vote by the [SC].

[SC]: <../../community-groups.md#steering-committee>
[WG]: <../../community-groups.md#working-groups>
