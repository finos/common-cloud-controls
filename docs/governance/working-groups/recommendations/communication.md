# Communication

## Mailing Lists

* A mailing list should be used as the main means of distributing written communications for all activities related to the CCC Project.

* To create a new mailing list email help@finos.org. Mailing Lists should only be created for a new [WG] or at the discretion of the [SC].

## Meetings

### FINOS Reporting Meetings

* These meetings will be used to report high level updates to the project and for FINOS representatives or [SC] to pass on appropriate updates.

* These meetings are advertised on the FINOS Calendar and follows FINOS anti-trust policies.

### Regular [WG] Meetings

* Some [WG]s may choose to hold regular meetings to provide a space for discussion of [WG] specific activities. 
* If a [WG] decides to have regular [WG] meetings, then the details of the meeting should be published to members of the [WG] using the corresponding mailing list.
* Any regular [WG] wide meetings should have minutes taken and made available.
* These meetings do not need to live in FINOS Calendar and hence it is not mandatory to follow FINOS anti-trust policies.

### Ad hoc [WG] Meetings

* Ad hoc meetings between [WG] members can be scheduled between group members as and when required. 
* Minutes of these meetings are not required.
* Any noteworthy decisions or outcomes should be communicated back to the wider [WG] via the mailing list.
* These meetings do not need to live in FINOS Calendar and hence it is not mandatory to follow FINOS anti-trust policies.
