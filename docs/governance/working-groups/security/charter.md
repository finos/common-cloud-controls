## Mission

This [WG] defines how a threat-informed control catalog can be used to assess the security of the common cloud services defined by the CCC services taxonomy working group.

The mission of the Security [WG] is to develop, maintain, and enhance a comprehensive threat-informed security control catalog specifically tailored to the CCC cloud services taxonomy. As part of the mission, the working group will explore how existing catalogs, knowledge bases and assessment frameworks can be leveraged to assess the security posture of CCC-relevant cloud services and ensure alignment with industry standards and best practices.

## Approach & Responsibilities

This group will:

- Collaborate with the [Duplication Reduction WG] to evaluate existing security controls catalogs, threat knowledge bases, risk-based assessments, assessment formats, and testing procedures
- Define and maintain effective measures to mitigate identified threats relative to the CCC services taxonomy
- Collaborate with industry experts, security researchers, and cloud service providers to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the project approaches and outputs
- Regularly update and expand the catalogs, assessment methodologies, and exploration of existing control catalogs to reflect evolving threats, emerging technologies, and best practices in cloud security
- Collaborate with the [Delivery WG] to determine an appropriate release process and cadence
- Review and incorporate relevant feedback gathered by the [Communications WG] from the community and end users
