## Mission

This [WG] defines and maintains the delivery process for the Common Cloud Controls project deliverables.

The mission of the Delivery [WG] is to establish and maintain robust communication channels, ensuring openness and clarity in all activities and decisions related to outputs and deliverables. We aim to curate a comprehensive repository of community outputs slated for release, diligently managing version control and devising optimal strategies for content dissemination.

By coordinating with fellow [WG]'s, we endeavor to synchronize release efforts, while meticulously defining and adhering to a structured release schedule, fostering efficiency and coherence in our endeavors.

- Create and maintain automation related to acceptance of content proposed to the project repository
- Maintain a list of all community outputs that need to be released
