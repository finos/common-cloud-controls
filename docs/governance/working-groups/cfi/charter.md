## Mission

The mission of the Compliant Financial Infrastructure (CFI) Working Group is to support the implementation of CCC standards across various computing environments—including cloud, on-premise, and hybrid infrastructure. This group ensures uniformity, quality, and discoverability of these implementations, and validates their compliance through automated testing procedures.

## Approach & Responsibilities

This group will:

* Define and maintain a standardized approach for implementing CCC standards across infrastructure platforms
* Ensure that all implementations are discoverable, version-controlled, and testable
* Establish and maintain automated compliance testing tools and validation frameworks
* Collaborate with the [Delivery WG] to publish implementations and testing results
* Work with the [Security WG] to ensure consistency and non-overlap of controls
* Integrate feedback from the community gathered by the [Communications WG]

### Output / Deliverables

Artifacts created by this group will be made publicly available in the project’s GitHub repository and will include:

* Reference implementations of CCC standards for various infrastructure types
* Automated test suites for compliance validation
* Documentation and deployment guides for contributors and adopters
* Dashboard or reporting tools for compliance visibility

## Out of Scope

The following are outside the scope of this working group:

* Implementation of CCC standards for application-level controls not related to infrastructure
* Manual validation processes or proprietary/non-open implementations

## Governance
