# Community Structure Working Group

This [WG] facilitates the structure and governance design for the Common Cloud Controls project community.

## Mission

The mission of the Community Structure [WG] is to establish robust, scalable, and efficient frameworks for the governance and operation of all community [WG]s within the CCC.

By designing clear guidelines and structures, this group ensures consistency and facilitates effective collaboration across the entire community. It acts as a central body to guide the formation and operation of other [WG]s, helping them align with the overarching goals of the CCC.

## Approach

- Work closely with community members and stakeholders to gather insights and requirements
- Maintain open and transparent communication channels for all WG activities and decisions
- Adapt processes and guidelines as necessary to meet the evolving needs of the community
- Ensure all decisions and guidelines are well-documented and accessible to the community
- Strive for representation from diverse community segments when forming recommendations

## Responsibilities

- Propose and maintain community policies and guidelines
- Provide advice and support to WGs
- Interface with FINOS team to implement repository controls

### Output / Deliverables

This group should, at minimum, create and maintain the following items in the project GitHub repository.

- Community organization strategy, including:
  - Group Naming conventions
  - Limitations
  - Formation Processes
- Community Group Charter Policy, including:
  - Charter Format & Contents
  - Proposal Policy
- Writing Conventions / Style Guide

## Out of Scope

This [WG] is not responsible for approving proposed policies or ensuring compliance with policies.

To reduce unilateral authority from either this group or the [SC], all policy proposals should come from this group and be finalized through a vote from the [SC].

## Membership

The membership structure of this [WG], including roles and responsibilities, must adhere to the latest [guidelines] from the Community Structure [WG].

Where guidelines do note yet exist on a topic, this [WG] should follow guidance from the CCC [SC].

## Community Cadence

A member of this [WG] should be present on for any calls scheduled by the [SC] for participation by the full CCC community, such as quarterly [SC] calls.

This [WG] will use the mail group <ccc-structure@lists.finos.org> for regular communications.

## Changes

Changes to this charter must be approved through a majority vote by the [SC].
