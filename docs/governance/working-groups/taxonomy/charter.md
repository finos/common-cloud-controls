## Mission

The mission of the Taxonomy [WG] is to define and maintain a comprehensive taxonomy of service(s) offered by the cloud hyperscalers. This initiative aims to establish a standardized nomenclature and attributes for common service categories such as VMs, Storage, and Networking. By creating this uniform taxonomy, the WG will facilitate the application of a set of controls across various cloud provider implementations, addressing common risks and promoting broader applicability of the CCC project's resources.

## Approach & Responsibilities

- Identify common cloud service categories, prioritizing those most commonly used within financial service institutions
- Create and maintain an index of all common service categories each organized by common categorical delineations
- Create and maintain a list of descriptions for the minimum viable capabilities of each service category
- Create and maintain an asset describing the ways to test the presence of each feature for a service
- Ensure all artifacts comply with requirements documented by the [Delivery WG] prior to release
- Collaborate with [Delivery WG] to publish each release on the agreed schedule
- Collaborate with the [Communications WG] to incorporate user feedback into the development cycle

### Output / Deliverables

The following artifacts will be created and stored in the project GitHub repo:

- Index of common service categories
- List of feature descriptions for each service in the index
- Test descriptions for each feature on each service

## Out of Scope

The following activities will not be performed by this group:

- Working on assets related to cybersecurity topics
