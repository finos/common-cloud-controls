# Common Cloud Control Taxonomy Working Group Charter

This document outlines the mission, scope, and objectives of the Common Cloud Controls (CCC) Taxonomy [WG].

## Mission

The mission of the Taxonomy [WG] is to define and maintain a comprehensive taxonomy of cloud services offered by the cloud hyperscalers.

## Objectives / Responsibilities

- This [WG] is responsible for coming up with the top-level cloud services taxonomy.
- This [WG] is responsible for breaking down each of the top-level taxonomies into more specific sub taxonomies.
- This [WG] is responsible for coming up with common cloud controls (features) for each of the identified taxonomies.
- This [WG] is responsible for coming up with newer versions of existing common cloud controls in timely manner.
- This [WG] is responsible for developing and maintaining set of technical design requirements for each of the identified common cloud controls. 

### Output / Deliverables

- Top level cloud services taxonomy markdown which will cover the core functionalities provided across all cloud service providers.
- Second level taxonomy markdown for each service taxonomy defined under the top-level taxonomies.
- A taxonomy markdown file per second level taxonomy, which will identify the minimum set of common cloud controls (features) that should be present for a service to be considered portable.
- A feature file per taxonomy markdown, that will contain technical design requirements for features identified under the taxonomy markdown file.

## Out of Scope

This [WG] is not responsible to maintaining a list of features provided by different cloud hyperscalers.

## Approach

- Will explore into cloud service categorizations done by other FINOS projects when defining the top/secondary level taxonomies
- Propose and agree upon a top level and second level taxonomies as a group.
- Identifying common set of features offered by AWS, Google, and Azure under each of the service taxonomies.
- Document the key features needed to make a architecture portable within cloud providers.
- Document technical design requirements as validation tests per taxonomy.
- Revisit the taxonomies to refine the common cloud controls in a timely manner.
- Maintain open and transparent communication channels for all WG activities and decisions regarding deliverables
