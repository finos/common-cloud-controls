## Purpose

This directory will contain the conten development standards and practices, where you can find all the necessary guidelines and standards for formatting, linting, and releasing content within our projects. The purpose of this folder is to provide clear, accessible guidelines that enhance our workflows and maintain high standards of quality. Adherence to these guidelines is crucial for maintaining the integrity and consistency of our content. All [WG]'s are required to follow these guidelines.

## How to Use These Guidelines

1. **Review Guidelines Before Starting Your Project:** Familiarize yourself with the formatting and linting standards to ensure your work aligns from the outset.
2. **Apply the Standards Consistently:** Please ensure that you have installed the necessary tools and enabled the automation locally (if applicable) to ensure you are following the standards consistently.
3. **Check Compliance Regularly:** Regularly review your work against these standards to ensure ongoing compliance, especially before merges and releases. We have automated processes in place that will check your MD files prior to being merged into the main branch.
