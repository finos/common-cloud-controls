# Community Guidelines

Guidelines are formal recommendations to the community provided as structured outputs from the Community Structure [WG]. While these guidelines have not been approved by the [SC] as official community policy, it is strongly advised that each [WG] follow the recommendations.

This directory will contain all guidelines recommended.

## Adding or Modifying a Guideline

- Changes can be suggested by anyone by raising a PR and notifying the Community Structure [WG] using the mailing list <ccc-structure@lists.finos.org> for consideration.
- Then the members of the Community Structure [WG] should discuss this issue in their [WG] meetings and approve the PR for it to become a recommendation.

## Upgrading a Recommendation to become a Policy

In order for a guideline to become a policy a [SC], they must be put forward for a [vote] by a [SC] member sponsor.

1. A pull request should be made by the [SC] sponsor to move the guideline into the [Policies] directory.
2. The [SC] sponsor should call a [SC] [vote] and if approved by the majority the PR can be merged and the recommendation is now a policy.

[Policies]: ../community-policies
[vote]: ../steering/charter.md#voting
[SC]: ../community-groups.md#steering-committee
[WG]: ../community-groups.md#working-groups
