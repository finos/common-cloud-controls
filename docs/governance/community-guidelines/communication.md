# Communication

This document is a [community guideline].

## Mailing Lists

- A mailing list should be used as the main means of distributing written communications for all activities related to the CCC Project.
- Mailing lists should be requested for a [WG] by the sponsoring SteerCo member upon passage of the charter vote.

## Meetings

### FINOS Hosted Meetings

All meetings hosted by FINOS are expected to follow FINOS Anti-Trust policies. 

Any meeting published on the public calendar must additionally adhere to a strict agenda, maintain public meeting minutes on this GitHub repo, and display the FINOS Anti-Trust slide at the beginning of the session.

### SteerCo Reporting Meetings

- Quarterly reporting meetings hosted by the [SC] should be attended by all [WG] leads or an appropriate delegate.
- These meetings will feature updates from each [WG] regarding the progress against their charter, followed by Q&A with the [SC]. Anyone may join to observe.
- These meetings should be hosted by FINOS and listed on the FINOS Calendar.

### Recurring [WG] Meetings

- A [WG] may choose to hold recurring meetings to provide a dedicated space for discussion of [WG]-specific activities. 
- If a [WG] decides to have recurring [WG] meetings, then the details of the meeting should be published to members of the [WG] using the corresponding mailing list.
- If these meetings are hosted by FINOS they must follow the guidance for [FINOS hosted meetings](#finos-hosted-meetings).
- If these meetings are NOT hosted by FINOS then where practical, these meetings should have notes or minutes published to the rest of the [WG].

### Ad hoc [WG] Meetings

- Ad hoc meetings between [WG] members can be scheduled between group members at their own discretion.
- If these meetings are hosted by FINOS they must follow the guidance for [FINOS hosted meetings](#finos-hosted-meetings).
- If these meetings are NOT hosted by FINOS then any noteworthy decisions or outcomes should be communicated back to the wider [WG] via the mailing list.
