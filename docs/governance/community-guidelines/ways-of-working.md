# Ways of Working

This document is a [community guideline].

The document outlines the general ways of working and details some of the expected interactions between [WG]s.

Community need will drive the direction of the project and requests will be processed by the [Communications WG]. The [Communications WG] will work with the [SC] to set the roadmap of the project at a high level.

The [Communications WG] will communicate the roadmap to the [Taxonomy WG]. The [Taxonomy WG] will expand the service catalog based on the direction set out in the roadmap and will pass completed services over to the [Security WG] who will catalog the security threats and securtiy controls of each service.

The [Delivery WG] will work closely with the [Taxonomy WG] and the [Security WG] so that they can put together releases. The [Delivery WG] will provide status/release updates back to the [Communications WG] who will then prepare communications to head back out to the community.
