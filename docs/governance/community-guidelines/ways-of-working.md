# Ways of Working

This document is a [community guideline].

The document outlines the general workflow and describes expected interactions between various working groups ([WG]s).

The community, or project contributers will put forward suggestions for services to be covered by the CCC project.

The [Communications WG] will update the project roadmap based on the suggested services and communicate the changes to the roadmap back the community and the project contributers.

The [Taxonomy WG] will update the taxonomy to include the services prioritized in the roadmap.

The [Security WG] will extend the taxonomy to include a list of the threats and controls for each service.

The [Delivery WG] will work with all working groups to determine best practices for releasing new versions of the taxonomy.

The [Communications WG] will work with all working groups to communicate updates and releases back to the community.
