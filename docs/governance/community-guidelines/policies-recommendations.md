# Policies & Recommendations

This document is a [community guideline].

## Policies

Policies are guidelines which have been proposed by the Community Structure [WG] and which have been approved by [SC] to become a policy.

All [WG]s must adhere to the policies.

## Recommendations

Recommendations are guidelines which have been suggested by the Community Structure [WG]. While these guidelines have not been approved by the [SC] and and not yet a formal policy it is strongly suggested that each [WG] follow the recommendations.

## New Recommendations

New recommendations can be suggested by anyone by raising a PR and sending it to the Community Structure [WG] using the mailing list <ccc-structure@lists.finos.org> for consideration and approval.

## Upgrading a Recommendation to become a Policy

In order for a recommendation to become a policy a [SC] sponsor must be found. The proposer can raise a PR with the necessary changes i.e. moving the recommendation to the policies directory. The [SC] sponsor can call a [SC] vote and if approved by the majority the PR can be merged and the recommendation is now a policy.

## Changes

Changes to all policies must be approved through a majority vote by the [SC].
