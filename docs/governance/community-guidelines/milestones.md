# Milestones

This document is a [community guideline].

## Purpose

Milestones are used to group GitHub issues related to a specific release. Each release should have a single top-level milestone attached to all targeted issues.

Each [WG] should create its own milestone for the release and attach it to all relevant issues. This means most issues related to a release will have two milestones: the main release milestone and the [WG] milestone.

This approach enhances visibility on the progress towards the release.
## Ownership
The [Communications WG] is responsible for the top-level milestone, as they set the roadmap and communicate project progress to the wider community. All [WG]s should significantly contribute to the content of each release.

Each [WG] should manage its own release-related milestone.
## Scheduling

The community should aim for several releases per year, ideally evenly distributed.
### OSFF Events

Where possible, releases should coincide with OSFF events. These events are excellent opportunities to showcase the project, making significant releases during these times beneficial for generating interest and discussion.
