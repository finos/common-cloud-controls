# Change Management Board

This document is a [community guideline].

## Purpose

The document outlines and defines the guidelines for the Change Management Board (CMB) for the Common Cloud Controls (CCC) project.

The CMB is a body of representatives from financial institutions of varying sizes and types. Its primary role is to review and approve changes and new catalogs that are within the Release Candidate. The CMB collectively represents end-user stakeholders, ensuring that each artifact is adaptable to the needs of a wide range of institutions while maintaining consistency and integrity across the board.

## Process

The process followed by the CMB to manage changes includes:

1. **Proposal Submission**
   - Proposed changes are submitted for CMB review by contributors or working groups within the CCC project.
1. **Review Cycle**
   - The CMB reviews the changes based on the established guidelines and feedback from relevant working groups such as the [Security WG], [Delivery WG], and others.
1. **Approval or Request for Modifications**
   - After review, the CMB either approves the proposed changes for the next release candidate or requests modifications and additional feedback from the contributor or associated working group.
1. **Final Approval and Release**
   - Upon receiving approval, the release manager compiles the final release package, and the CMB confirms the official release of the updated framework.

## Membership

The change management board is composed of a Release Manager and the body of reviewers, both appointed by the [Delivery WG].

A release cycle shall be a minimum of one month, during which time a Release Manager will solicit and arbitrate feedback from the reviewers prior to approving and initiating the release.

### Release Manager Responsibilities

The release manager is not a unilateral authority on the release, rather they are the representative of the group's opinions. Insomuch as they represent the CMB, the release manager holds the final guidance in the lifecycle of an asset.

The release manager will be responsible for the following:

- Collaborate with the CCC working group leads to ensure that the asset is ready for review.
- Issue an announcement to the CMB, containing:
  - Links to the asset under review
  - Desired release date
  - Deadline for initial responses (two weeks prior to desired release date)
  - Instructions for participating in this review cycle
- When a change request (CR) is received:
  - Evaluate the quality of the CR. If necessary, request adjustments for clarity or conciseness.
  - Relay the CR to all participating reviewers
  - At least two members must agree on a CR before it moves forward, with majority opinion ruling when there is dissent.
  - When discussion has been stabilized for at least 48 hours, determine the status of the CR
  - If the CR is affirmed by the CMB, create a GitHub issue detailing the CR. Tag and notify the appropriate working group.
  - If the CR is not affirmed by the CMB, notify the change requestor. The CR should not be resubmitted unless there are substantial changes to the request.
- When all outstanding requests have been resolved and requested changes have been applied, initiate the release.
  - Ensure that the release is no sooner than the expected delivery date, and that all actions follow the current processes of the [Delivery WG].

### Reviewer Responsibilities

Members are **not** obligated to review every release but will be notified and may choose to engage in reviews. [Read about the process here.](./member-responsibilities.md)

### Qualifications for Participation

Individuals of any background or experience level may participate in a review.

To approve or request changes, an individual must be an appointed CMB member in good standing.

CMB members are appointed by the [Delivery WG]. If you are interested or have any questions, please reach out to a current [Delivery WG] member or join the community call.

### Release Manager Qualifications
