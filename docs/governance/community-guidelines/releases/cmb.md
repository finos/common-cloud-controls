# Change Management Board

This document is a [community guideline].

## Purpose

The document outlines and defines the guidelines for the Change Management Board (CMB) for the Common Cloud Controls (CCC) project.

The Change Management Board (CMB) is a collaborative body composed of representatives from multiple banks of varying sizes and other external organizations. Its primary role is to oversee and approve changes and new catalogs that are within the Release Candidate. The CMB acts as a governing entity, facilitating discussion and arbitration when necessary, to ensure that all stakeholder concerns are addressed before approving release candidates for official publication. This diverse representation ensures that the framework is adaptable to the needs of a wide range of institutions while maintaining consistency and integrity across the board.

## Responsibilities

The key responsibilities of the CMB include:

1. **Review of Proposed Changes**

   - The CMB reviews all proposed changes to the CCC framework, ensuring they meet security and compliance standards, and align with both internal and external regulations.

2. **Approval of Release Candidates**

   - The board evaluates release candidates and either approves them for official release or requests further changes.

3. **Arbitration of Change Requests**

   - The CMB arbitrates any disputes or unresolved issues related to proposed changes, ensuring that all stakeholders reach a consensus before final approval.

4. **Monitoring and Adapting to Industry Standards**
   - The CMB ensures that the CCC framework remains aligned with evolving industry standards, adjusting guidelines as needed to stay compliant with new regulations and technological advancements.

## Membership

The CMB is comprised of representatives from the following:

1. **FSIs of Varying Sizes**

   - Representatives from banks of different scales, ensuring that the interests and needs of both small and large financial institutions are accounted for.

2. **External Organizations**
   - Representatives from various other organizations also welcomed to join this effort.

## Process

The process followed by the CMB to manage changes includes:

1. **Proposal Submission**

   - Proposed changes are submitted for CMB review by contributors or working groups within the CCC project.

2. **Review Cycle**

   - The CMB reviews the changes based on the established guidelines and feedback from relevant working groups such as the [Security WG], [Delivery WG], and others.

3. **Approval or Request for Modifications**

   - After review, the CMB either approves the proposed changes for the next release candidate or requests modifications and additional feedback from the contributor or associated working group.

4. **Final Approval and Release**
   - Upon receiving approval, the release manager compiles the final release package, and the CMB confirms the official release of the updated framework.

## Collaboration with Working Groups

The CMB works closely with the following working groups:

- [Delivery WG]: Oversees the delivery and implementation of the proposed changes.

[Security WG]: ../working-groups/security/charter.md
[Delivery WG]: ../working-groups/delivery/charter.md
[community guideline]: ./README.md
