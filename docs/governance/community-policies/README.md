# Community Policies

Policies are rules which have been proposed by the Community Structure [WG] and which have been approved by [SC] to govern the operation of the CCC community.

All [WG] charters should contain a reference to these policies, with a commitment to adhere to any policies that apply to that group's circumstance. This contrasts with [community-guidelines], which are guidelines that the community is strongly advised to consider.

This directory will contain the latest version of all policies that must be adhered to for a [WG] to retain its charter.

## Adding or Modifying a Policy

Policies may be created or modified by a [vote] of the [SC] at any time, following the same process as [Upgrading a Recommendation to become a Policy](../community-guidelines/README.md/#upgrading-a-recommendation-to-become-a-policy).

[SC]: ../community-groups.md#steering-committee
[vote]: ../steering/charter.md#voting
