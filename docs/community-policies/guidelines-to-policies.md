# Upgrading a Recommendation to become a Policy

This document is a [community policy].

In order for a community guideline to become a community policy, the guideline must pass a [SC] [vote]. A [vote] can be called for by a [SC] member sponsor or the [Community Structure WG] Lead.

1. A pull request should be made by the [SC] member sponsor or [Community Structure WG] Lead to move the guideline into the [Policies] directory.
2. The [SC] member sponsor or [Community Structure WG] Lead should call a [SC] [vote] and, if approved by the majority, the PR can be merged and the recommendation is now a policy.
3. The vote will be initiated on the pull request using [GitVote], enabling [SC] members to cast their votes directly on the associated pull request.
4. The voting period will remain open for 7 days.
5. A majority vote is required for the proposal to pass.
