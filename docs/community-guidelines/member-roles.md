## Inactive Members

A core principle in maintaining a healthy community is encouraging active
participation. It is inevitable that people's focuses will change over time and
they are not expected to be actively contributing forever.

Inactive members are those who carry an aforementioned role or title within CCC
with **zero** qualifying contributions in the preceding 6 months.

Inactive members will be removed from their roles and will need to re-engage with the
community and go through the aforementioned processes again to regain their status.

Specific group charters may specify a shorter period for their roles.
