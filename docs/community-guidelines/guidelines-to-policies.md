# Upgrading a Recommendation to become a Policy

In order for a community guideline to become a community policy, the guidline must pass a [SC] [vote]. A [vote] can be called for by a [SC] member sponsor or the [Community Structure WG] Lead.

1. A pull request should be made by the [SC] sponsor or [Community Structure WG] Lead to move the guideline into the [Policies] directory.
2. The [SC] sponsor or [Community Structure WG] Lead should call a [SC] [vote] and if approved by the majority the PR can be merged and the recommendation is now a policy.

[Policies]: ../community-policies
[vote]: ../governance/steering/charter.md#voting
[SC]: ../governance/community-structure.md#steering-committee
[Community Structure WG]: ../governance/community-structure.md#working-groups
