## Purpose

This directory will contain the content development standards and practices, where you can find all the necessary policies and standards for formatting, linting, and releasing content within our projects. The purpose of this folder is to provide clear, accessible policies that enhance our workflows and maintain high standards of quality. Adherence to these policies is crucial for maintaining the integrity and consistency of our content. All [WG]'s are required to follow these policies.

## How to Use These Policies

1. **Review Policies Before Starting Your Project:** Familiarize yourself with the formatting and linting standards to ensure your work aligns from the outset.
2. **Apply the Guidelines Consistently:** Please ensure that you have installed the necessary tools and enabled the automation locally (if applicable) to ensure you are following the standards consistently.
3. **Check Compliance Regularly:** Regularly review your work against these standards to ensure ongoing compliance, especially before merges and releases. We have automated processes in place that will check your Markdown files prior to being merged into the main branch.

## Feedback and Contribution Disclaimer

Feedback on these policies is vital for continuous improvement. If you have suggestions or updates, please communicate this to the [Delivery WG]. Do note that new policies and standards may be created or modified by a [vote] of the [SC] at any time, following the same process as [Upgrading a Recommendation to become a Policy](../../community-guidelines/README.md#upgrading-a-recommendation-to-become-a-policy).
