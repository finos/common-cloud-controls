## Chairing Meetings

It is the responsibility of the [WG] lead to chair the meetings for their [WG].

In the event the [WG] lead is unable to attend the meeting they should appoint an appropriate delegate from within the [WG] to chair the meeting in their absence. If there are no appropriate delegates for the [WG] then the [FINOS Point of Contact] can be contacted to see if they can chair the meeting.

In the event there are no suitable people to chair the meeting then the meeting should be cancelled.

### Responsibilities of the Chair

The Chair of the meeting is responsible for:

- Opening the Zoom Call: Start the meeting and admit participants.
- Minutes and Attendance: Ensure someone is taking minutes and that attendees log their attendance by commenting on the issue.
- Agenda Adherence: Ensure the meeting follows the agenda.
- Closing the Meeting: Conclude the meeting.

## Meeting Agendas

### Agenda Items

The [WG] lead is responsible for creating an agenda for each meeting. The [WG] lead can seek input from other [WG] members via the mailing list. Alternatively, members can proactively suggest items by reaching out to the [WG] lead.

### Creating the agenda

To create a meeting agenda you can create a new issue in the CCC project on GitHub and selecting the `Common Cloud Controls Meeting Minutes` template.

Update the issue with the correct date/time and add the [WG] name to the end of the issue title.

Update the issue with the correct zoom details.

Fill in the agenda items for the meeting, taking care not to delete any of the items predefined by the template.

Add the `Meeting` label to the issue.

## Meeting Minutes

Minutes can be added as a comment to the corresponding GitHub issue.

Consider circulating the minutes via the mailing list to increase visibility within the [WG].

## Post Meeting Housekeeping

Once minutes are added to the GitHub issue, close the issue.

## Cancelling a Meeting

In the event that a meeting needs to be cancelled then the [FINOS Point of Contact] should be notified as soon as possible. The cancellation should also be communicated via the mailing list for the [WG].
