# CMB Member Responsibilities

As a member of the change management board (CMB), you will be invited to review any release candidate so that you may identify issues with the controls standard prior to the official release.

[Find information about the CMB and underlying processes here.](./README.md)

## Participation

The Release Manager will create the discussion post within GitHub for the release candidate, which is where you will be expected to leave your feedback. Please follow this guide: [Feedback Guide](feedback-guide.md)

Several release candidates may be open at the same time. Members are not obligated in any specific review, but are highly encouraged to participate in areas where they have subject matter expertise.

## Expectations

- Be thorough, thoughtful, and provide detailed feedback before requesting changes.
  - Gather feedback from colleagues as needed to support a review.
- If changes are requested, communicate clearly and promptly through the channels outlined by the Release Manager for the current release cycle.
  - When a change request (CR) is received, the Release Manager will open discussions and facilitate responses from the board.
- Members are encouraged to respond within 7 days if they have input on a CR.
  - The Release Manager logs any dissenting opinions and communicates the majority decision.
- A release cannot proceed without a minimum of 5 approvals; members are encouraged to help meet this threshold by approving, requesting changes, or contributing to discussion around open change requests.
