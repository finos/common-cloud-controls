## What Is It?

FINOS Common Cloud Controls (FINOS CCC) is an open standard project that describes consistent controls for compliant public cloud deployments in the financial services (FS) sector.

This standard is a collaborative project which aims to develop a unified set of cybersecurity, resiliency, and compliance controls for common services across the major cloud service providers (CSPs).

## What Are The Benefits?

#### ðŸ’¯ Defining Best Practices Around Cloud Security

> CCC aims to standardize cloud security controls for the banking sector, providing a common set of controls that CSPs can implement to meet the requirements of FS firms. As multiple FS firms are involved in the project, effort is shared, the controls will be representative of the sector as a whole, and be more robust than any one firm could develop on its own.

#### ðŸŽ¯ One Target For CSPs To Conform To

> If all FS firms specify their own cloud infrastructure requirements, CSPs will have to conform to multiple standards. CCC aims to provide a single target for CSPs to conform to.

#### ðŸŽ’ Sharing The Burden Of A Common Definition

> CCC aims to reduce the burden of compliance for CSPs by providing a common definition of controls which they can adopt. As CCC controls are specified in a cloud-agostic way, CSPs can implement them in a way that is consistent with their own infrastructure, while delivering services that FS firms understand and trust.

#### ðŸ§­ A Path Towards Common Implementation

> FINOS sister project, [Compliant Financial Infrastructure](https://github.com/finos/compliant-financial-infrastructure) aims to be a downstream implementation of the CCC controls standard. In tandem with CCC, this will provide FS firms with a one-stop shop for secure cloud infrastructure deployment.

#### ðŸ¥‡ A Path Towards Certification

> It is envisaged that eventually, CCC will offer _certification_ for CSPs who conform to the standard.

## How Does It Work?

The CCC project is in **incubation** at the moment but aims to deliver its first standards in 2024. The project is split into 6 working groups, each with a specific focus:

- **Communications / All Hands**: Focused on the overall project communications and community engagement.
- **Security** - Working to specify the security controls and threats that will be covered by the standard.
- **Community Structure** - Focused on the governance and structure of the CCC project.
- **Duplication Reduction** - Focused on ensuring that the CCC standard does not duplicate existing standards.
- **Taxonomy** - Focused on defining the taxonomy of cloud services that will be covered by the standard.
- **Delivery** - Focused on the delivery of the CCC standard for use downstream by FS firms and CSPs.

Work is done in the open, with all meetings and decisions documented in the project GitHub repository.
