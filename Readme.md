FINOS Common Cloud Controls (FINOS CCC) is the codename for an open standard project, originally proposed by Citi and currently incubating in FINOS, to describe consistent controls for compliant public cloud deployments in the financial services sector.

This standard is a collaborative project which aims to develop a unified set of cybersecurity, resiliency, and compliance controls for common services across the major cloud service providers (CSPs).

## OSCAL Representation of FINOS CCC Working Group
The OSCAL Representation of the Common Cloud Controls (CCC) Working Group aims to establish a standardized and collaborative framework for expressing the FINOS CCC within the [OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/) format. In the event that modifications to OSCAL are necessary to fully support the CCC, we will actively engage with the NIST community to facilitate these enhancements.

### Key Objectives
1. OSCAL Artifacts: Develop OSCAL control catalogs, profiles, and/or component definitions meticulously tailored to reflect the core services of major Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), based on the taxonomy and data from other working groups.
2. Adaptive Framework: Institute a robust framework and accompanying change management processes to ensure the OSCAL representation of the FINOS CCC remains synchronized with evolving regulatory mandates, control best practices, and emergent compliance frameworks.

### Expected Output
* A definition of where CCC elements are represented in OSCAL
* CCC OSCAL Control Catalog, Profile and/or Component definition of each major CSP services
* Robust governance framework defining change management and required tool set to ensure sustainability of OSCAL files
