style_guide:
  general:
    - Structure each capability with id, title, description.

  id:
    - Use the format CCC.<service-id>.F<seq-number>
    - Service id can be found in the `id` field of the `metadata.yaml` file.
    - Service id should be less than 8 characters.

  titles:
    - Should be short and concise (≤10 words).
    - Use title case.
    - Avoid special characters except hyphens.
    - Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood.
  descriptions:
  - Must start with "The service…".
  - Use multi-line text which starts with `|`
  - Use present tense and active voice.
  - Prefer single-sentence descriptions:
      - Combine related actions into one cohesive sentence
      - Use subordinate clauses to express purpose or outcome (e.g., "to prevent...")
      - Use "when" clauses to describe triggering conditions
      - Use "but" or "before" to show sequence or contrast between actions
  - MUST use precise temporal terms in every description:
      - "always" or "automatically": capability exists by default without configuration
      - "may be configured" or "can": capability requires configuration or is optional
      - Every description MUST include one of these terms to indicate whether the capability is default or configurable
  - Use precise technical terms consistently:
      - user: a human or entity interacting with the service
      - component: an internal module of the service
      - child resource: an external resource created by the service, but managed, or contained outside the service
      - external system: an external service, application, or system that interacts with the service

  formatting:
    - Use consistent YAML syntax with proper indentation
