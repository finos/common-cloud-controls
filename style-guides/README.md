# Style Guides

A style guide defines the rules, structure, and conventions that should be followed when writing. Defining the style guide in YAML format ensures:

- **Consistency** - all YAML files look and behave the same way.
- **Readability** - humans can easily understand the content.
- **Machine Interpretability** - tools and AI assistants can parse and use it reliably.

## Catalog Style Guides

Style guides are included for capabilities, threats, and controls in the catalog to maintain consistency, clarity, and quality across all entries.

They ensure that contributions from different authors follow the same structure, tone, and level of detail, which makes the catalog easier to understand, compare, and extend. Consistent formatting also supports automated processingâ€”for example, enabling AI models or scripts to reliably interpret and generate new entries.

These style guides are designed to be both **human-readable and machine-readable**. You can provide them to an AI assistant to help automatically generate or validate capabilities, threats, and controls for a given service, ensuring that all outputs conform to the same editorial and structural standards.
