style_guide:
  general:
    - "Structure each control with id, title, objective, assessment-requirements, threat-mappings, and guideline-mappings."
    - "Controls are grouped under control-families with a title and description."
    - "Use a formal, objective, and prescriptive tone throughout."

  control_families:
    title:
      - "Should be concise (≤5 words)."
      - "Use title case."
      - "Represent a broad category of security concerns (e.g., 'Data', 'Access', 'Monitoring')."
    description:
      - "Must use multi-line text which starts with '|'"
      - "Start with 'The [Family Name] control family...'"
      - "Use present tense and active voice."
      - "Explain the overarching purpose and scope of the control family."
      - "Include what aspects the controls govern (e.g., 'how data is transmitted, stored...')."

  id:
    - "Use the format CCC.<service-id>.C<seq-number>"
    - "Service id can be found in the 'id' field of the 'metadata.yaml' file."
    - "Service id should be less than 8 characters."

  titles:
    - "Should be concise (≤12 words)."
    - "Use title case."
    - "Frame as an imperative action (e.g., 'Encrypt Data for Transmission', 'Enforce Access Controls')."
    - "Clearly state what must be done, not why or when."
    - "Avoid special characters except hyphens."

  objectives:
    - "Must use multi-line text which starts with '|'"
    - "Begin with 'Ensure that...' or similar directive phrases."
    - "Use present tense and active voice."
    - "State the security outcome or goal the control achieves."
    - "Keep to a single sentence when possible."
    - "Focus on the 'why' - the security benefit or protection provided."

  assessment_requirements:
    id:
      - "Use the format CCC.<service-id>.CN<control-seq>.AR<req-seq-number>"
      - "TR stands for 'Technical Requirement'"
      - "Sequential numbering within each control (TR01, TR02, etc.)"
    text:
      - "Must use multi-line text which starts with '|'"
      - "Use conditional structure when applicable: 'When [condition], [action] MUST [requirement]'"
      - "Use 'MUST' for mandatory requirements (RFC 2119 compliance)."
      - "Use present tense throughout."
      - "Be specific and testable - requirements should be verifiable."
      - "Include technical specifications (e.g., 'TLS 1.3 or higher', 'SSHv2 or higher')."
      - "Use 'AND' to combine multiple mandatory conditions within a single requirement."
    applicability:
      - "List Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) levels where the requirement applies."
      - "Valid values: tlp-clear, tlp-green, tlp-amber, tlp-red"
      - "Order from least to most restrictive."
      - "More restrictive requirements typically apply to higher TLP levels (amber, red)."
    recommendation:
      - "Must use multi-line text which starts with '|'"
      - "Provide practical implementation guidance."
      - "Use imperative mood (e.g., 'Ensure that...', 'Review...', 'Configure...')."
      - "Include specific actions or configurations when possible."
      - "Reference relevant standards or registries where applicable."
      - "May include scanning, monitoring, or maintenance activities."

  threat_mappings:
    - "Reference threats that the control helps prevent or mitigate."
    - "Use the reference-id field to specify the threat set (typically matches service-id)."
    - |
      Each entry must include:
        reference-id: the threat ID (e.g., CCC.Core.TH02)

  guideline_mappings:
    - "Reference external compliance frameworks and standards."
    - "The reference-id for mappings must be an ID defined in metadata.mapping-references[]"
    - |
      Common frameworks include:
        CCM: Cloud Controls Matrix
        NIST-CSF: NIST Cybersecurity Framework
        ISO_27001: ISO/IEC 27001 standard
        NIST_800_53: NIST Special Publication 800-53
        OWASP: Open Web Application Security Project
        PCI-DSS: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
    - |
      Each entry must include:
        reference-id: the external framework control ID
        remarks: (optional) the control title or description for human readability
        strength: (optional, for CCM) numeric value indicating mapping strength (1-10)

  formatting:
    - "Use consistent YAML syntax with proper indentation."
    - "Assessment requirements should be ordered logically (general to specific, or by protocol type)."
    - "Guideline mappings should be grouped by framework."
    - "Maintain consistent spacing between major sections."
