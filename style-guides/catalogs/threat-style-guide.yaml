threat_style_guide:
  general:
    - Structure each threat with id, title, description, capabilities, and external-mappings.
    - Use a formal, objective, and precise tone throughout.

  id:
    - Use the format CCC.<service-id>.TH<seq-number>
    - Service id can be found in the `id` field of the `metadata.yaml` file.
    - Service id should be less than 8 characters.
  titles:
    - Should be concise (â‰¤12 words).
    - Use title case.
    - Clearly state an action or outcome that should be prevented.
    - Frame as a negative event or security failure (e.g., "Access is Granted to...", "Data is Exposed to...").
    - Avoid special characters except hyphens.
  descriptions:
    - Must follow a three-part structure:
        1. Circumstances: Begin with the conditions or mechanisms that could lead to the threat occurring
        2. Effect: Describe what happens to the system if the threat manifests
        3. Impact: Include the impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability of resources or data
    - Use multi-line text which starts with `|`
    - Use complete sentences and present tense.
    - Use passive voice when describing threat manifestation (e.g., "may be misconfigured", "could be exploited").
    - Avoid subjective or speculative language (e.g., "might possibly", "could potentially").
    - Avoid intent-based phrases like "accidental", "malicious", "intentional", or "deliberately".
    - Focus on technical mechanisms and outcomes rather than attacker motivations.
    - Use precise technical terms consistently:
      - user: a human or entity interacting with the service
      - component: an internal module of the service
      - child resource: an external resource created by the service, but managed, or contained outside the service
      - external system: an external service, application, or system that interacts with the service
  capabilities:
    - Reference capabilities that are relevant to preventing or mitigating the threat.
    - Use the reference-id field to specify the capability set (typically matches service-id).
    - Each entry must include:
        - reference-id: the capability ID (e.g., CCC.Core.F06)
        - remarks: the capability title for human readability
  external-mappings:
    - Reference external threat frameworks and standards.
    - The reference-id for mappings must be an ID defined in metadata.mapping-references[]
    - Common frameworks include:
        - MITRE-ATT&CK: for adversary tactics and techniques
        - OWASP-Top-10: for web application security risks
        - CWE: for common weakness enumerations
    - Each entry must include:
        - reference-id: the external framework entry ID
        - remarks: the entry title or description for human readability

  formatting:
    - Use consistent YAML syntax with proper indentation
    - Maintain alphabetical or logical ordering of threats within categories
