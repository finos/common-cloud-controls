# June 2025 OSFF Workshop 

_Some notes used to create the vector store example used in the workshop._

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Plan of Action

1.  Pick a service.
2.  Create the service family.
   1.  Create the taxonomy entry in the `service-category.yaml` file
   2.  Familiarise yourself with the services available in the cloud providers.
3.  Ask chatGpt to give a list of the main features of the service, handing it the variats from the different CSPs.  Show it
    1.  the object storage bucket features
    2.  and the common features file
    3.  and ask it to write up its features in a similar way (JSON format), keeping common features where they exist
4.  For the brand new features it has listed, ask it to do a threat analysis, listing out any common threats it perceives.
5.  Give it the example threats file from the storage bucket, ask it to produce the same.
6.  Give it the controls.yaml file from the storage bucket, ask for the same for the service you're doing.
7.  Build a PR
8.  Pass the checks

&nbsp;

### Pick a service

> We are working on the FINOS Common Cloud Controls project, building a definition of the vector store service: Managed vector database Store embeddings, similarity search Amazon OpenSearch Serverless w/ k-NN, Neptune Analytics Azure AI Search (vector), Cosmos DB w/ index Vertex AI Search, AlloyDB w/ pgvector. (a generic listing for any of these). Take a look at the attached JSON file describing an object storage bucket and write a similar one for vector stores.

```yaml
metadata:
  id: CCC.VectorStore
  title: Managed Vector Store
  description: |
    A Managed Vector Store is a specialized data service designed to store, index, and retrieve high-dimensional vector embeddings, enabling similarity search and machine learning inference. These services are used in AI/ML pipelines for use cases such as semantic search, recommendation systems, and generative AI applications. Vector stores support operations like nearest neighbor search using approximate or exact methods and integrate with model-serving and ingestion pipelines. They are optimized for performance, scale, and integration with cloud-native tools.

### Ask chatGpt to give a list of the main features of the service, handing it the variats from the different CSPs.

> ok, now we're going to generate the list of capabilities. First, why don't you just generate a bullet-list of the main features that a vector store should have, irrespective of which particular instance it is (some examples were given above)

```
Absolutely — here’s a comprehensive list of core capabilities that a **Managed Vector Store** should have, agnostic of cloud provider or implementation:

---

### ✅ Core Capabilities of a Managed Vector Store

* **Vector Embedding Storage**
  Store high-dimensional vector representations (embeddings) generated from text, images, or other data modalities.

  Create and manage indexes (e.g., HNSW, IVF, PQ, ScaNN, etc.) to support efficient similarity search.

* **Similarity Search (k-Nearest Neighbor)**
  Perform approximate or exact nearest-neighbor searches to find vectors most similar to a given query vector.

* **Multi-modal Support**
  Support embeddings derived from various data types (e.g., text, image, audio).

* **Filtering and Metadata Search**

### For the brand new features it has listed, ask it to do a threat analysis, listing out any common threats it perceives.

> ok, let's move onto threats. For each of these vector-specific threats (i.e. not the common ones), can you list out the main threats faced by deployers of this technology enabling this capability?

```
Absolutely — let’s walk through **vector store-specific threats** by capability. Below, each capability is followed by a set of **realistic threats** that a deployer of managed vector databases might face. I’ll exclude general cloud threats (e.g. misconfigured IAM, unencrypted data at rest) and focus only on threats **specific to the nature of vector storage, indexing, and querying**.

---

### **CCC.Vector.CP01 – Embedding Storage**

**Threats:**

* **Model inversion attacks:** Adversaries may reverse-engineer stored embeddings to reconstruct input data (e.g. text or images).
* **Sensitive data leakage:** Embeddings may contain PII or confidential semantic signals even if the original data is removed.
* **Improper embedding sanitation:** Ingesting unvalidated or adversarial embeddings could introduce poisoned data into downstream models.

---

### **CCC.Vector.CP02 – Vector Indexing**

**Threats:**

* **Index poisoning:** Attackers could pollute the index with crafted embeddings that bias search results or degrade quality.
* **DoS via index fragmentation:** Repeated updates and deletions can degrade index performance or lead to excessive reindexing.

---

### **CCC.Vector.CP03 – Similarity Search**

**Threats:**

* **Embedding extraction/inference:** High-volume similarity queries can allow attackers to infer what embeddings are stored.
* **Membership inference:** Determining if a particular input was used to train a model or is stored in the vector database.
* **Query amplification attacks:** Using repeated small queries to infer patterns in high-dimensional space (shadow modeling).

---

### **CCC.Vector.CP04 – Metadata Filtering**

**Threats:**

* **Metadata leakage:** Poorly configured access controls may expose sensitive labels, user tags, or classification metadata.
* **Query correlation:** Attackers could combine vector and metadata filters to triangulate private data attributes.

---

### **CCC.Vector.CP05 – Batch Ingestion**

**Threats:**

* **Bulk poisoning:** Attackers could upload massive volumes of low-quality, adversarial, or malicious embeddings.
* **Quota exhaustion:** Flooding the store to hit capacity limits and block ingestion for other users (storage starvation).

---

### **CCC.Vector.CP06 – Real-Time Querying**

**Threats:**

* **Low-latency enumeration:** Real-time APIs can be abused to brute-force similarity matches in near real time.
* **Service degradation:** High-frequency queries degrade latency for legitimate users (query-based DoS).

---

### **CCC.Vector.CP07 – Index Lifecycle Management**

**Threats:**

* **Unauthorized index manipulation:** Improper permissions may allow attackers to delete or rebuild indexes to sabotage accuracy.
* **Rollback abuse:** Malicious actors may restore outdated or poisoned index snapshots if versioning isn’t access-controlled.

---

### **CCC.Vector.CP08 – Embedding Format Compatibility**

**Threats:**

* **Unsupported format injection:** Submitting malformed vectors that evade validation or crash underlying indexing engines.
* **Embedding mismatch:** Using incompatible formats (e.g. cosine vs. dot product) can create silent logical errors exploitable in results.

---

### **CCC.Vector.CP09 – Vector Dimension Management**

**Threats:**

* **Dimensional inconsistency:** Allowing variable dimensions can lead to index corruption or query failure.
* **Overfitting exploits:** Attackers may use high-dimension vectors to overfit and manipulate similarity outcomes.

---

### **CCC.Vector.CP10 – Multi-modal Vector Support**

**Threats:**

* **Cross-modal leakage:** Linking vectors across modalities (e.g., voice and face) could re-identify individuals.
* **Inference via modality correlations:** Attackers could infer input type or category from stored embeddings.

---

### **CCC.Vector.CP11 – Query Access Control**

**Threats:**

* **Excessive read privilege:** Users with query access can extract sensitive embeddings even if they can't modify them.
* **Side-channel leakage:** Differing query latencies or results based on access can leak access control details.

---

### **CCC.Vector.CP12 – Approximate or Exact Search Modes**

**Threats:**

* **Search bias exploitation:** Approximate algorithms may yield non-deterministic results — exploitable for evasion or adversarial outcomes.
* **Precision downgrade attacks:** Attackers may force ANN mode on sensitive queries where exact match is required.

---

Would you like these compiled into a `threats.yaml`-style structure with threat IDs next? Or do you want to start drafting controls that mitigate these threats?

### Give it the controls.yaml file from the storage bucket, ask for the same for the service you're doing.

> ok, yes, lets' move onto controls. For each of the threats you've identified, please sketch out some controls that you might put in place. I'll give you the object storage file as an example again, and the common controls too

```
Great. Based on the **seven vector-specific threats** identified earlier, here’s a structured list of corresponding **controls** (not yet fully formatted in CCC YAML style, but ready for that next step). These are conceptually aligned with the style and taxonomy used in the Object Storage controls, and reference common CCC controls where applicable.

Would you like me to now turn these into a formal `controls.yaml` block with full control-family, assessment-requirements, and threat mappings?

```

&nbsp;

> ok, this is great: let's invert this and produce a list of controls and the threats they address. Don't include controls that are already common to ccc, just include the new, vector-store controls.
> 
> ok, check again the included yaml file - many of your controls "overlap" common ones. We just need the specific new ones. for example, access controls is a common one.
> 
> yes, let me give you the common controls and the object store controls files to look at. Don't forget to include the comments (titles of threats / controls you're referencing)
> 
> This is ok. However, I'd like a bit more. Can you reference common threats as well as vector threats. Also, include any common controls you think are needed. Don't forget comments alongside the references in the JSON file
> 
> ok, just missing the shared-controls section
